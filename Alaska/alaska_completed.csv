FINAL ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST
9
AND IMPOSING CIVIL FINE
10
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
11
1. The Division of Banking, Securities, and Corporations (division) within the
12
Department of Community and Economic Development is charged with enforcement of the
13
Alaska Securities Act (Act).
14
2. The Respondent company, Nu Life Investment Technology (Nu Life), has a
15
Miami, Florida, address and also an address in Porlamar, Venezuela. The working address
16
for Ken Fisher, senior representative, is unknown, but is probably the Florida address: Nu
17
Life NetZone 116, 7801 N.W. 37th Street, Miami, FL 33166-6559.
18
3. On June 9, 2001, Ken Fisher contacted E. R. and AL. R., an Anchorage
19
couple in their eighties, and inveigled them to give Fisher their credit card number in order
20
to receive a membership in British Premium Bond Program. Fisher charged $2,995.53 to
21
the card. The Rs' daughter-in-law contacted Visa on their behalf and apparently had the
22
transaction reversed.
23
4. This scheme constitutes a security under Alaska law for the following
24
reasons:
25
ALASKA ORDER # 02-04 S
Page 1
VIU
1
a. the scheme uses the name Nu Life Investment Technology and uses the
2
term ""investment"" in several places;
3
b. whether or not genuine, the scheme purports to sell ""bonds"" to its victims,
4
and bonds are clearly securities;
5
C. despite the first two factors, the scheme is an investment contract under
6
the definition enunciated in Securities & Exch. Comm'n V. W. J. Howey
7
Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1103 (1946); this definition states:
8
[An investment contract is] a contract, transaction or scheme
whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise
9
and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the
promoter or some third party.""
10
5. The Act at AS 45.55.070 requires all securities sold in Alaska to be registered
11
with the division, unless exempt.
12
6. A check of division records revealed that Respondents at no time registered
13
in Alaska or applied for an exemption for this sale.
14
7. The Act at AS 45.55.010 forbids the use of a device, scheme, or artifice to
15
defraud.
16
8. The materials received by the Rs. contain several instances of the use of
17
fraudulent statements that tout their program. Nu Life says their investment program has
18
grown ""to be one of the most appreciated bonds in the world"" without substantiation. Nu
19
Life states that their ""Senior Representative is looking forward to guiding [the Rs.] towards
20
the Millionaires Circle"" implying that investment in the program guarantees a member
21
becoming a millionaire.
22
9. The Act at AS 45.55.030 forbids a person acting as an agent in this state
23
unless registered.
24
10. A check of division records reveals no registration as an agent for Ken
25
ALASKA ORDER # 02-04 S
Page 2
1
Fisher.
2
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
3
11. Nu Life purports to be a program in which all memberships include
4
ownership of ""Premium Bonds"" to be held by the company acting on behalf of bond owners,
5
and winnings are to be directed to bond owners by the senior representative of Nu Life.
6
Thus, it is an investment of money in a common enterprise which depends for its success
7
on the actions of a third party. It is, therefore, an investment contract and a security subject
8
to the Alaska Securities Act.
9
12. Nu Life is a security, subject to the Alaska Securities Act, and at no time
10
received a registration or exemption in Alaska. Therefore, the sale of memberships in the
11
Nu Life Investment Technology program is a sale of unregistered securities in violation of
12
AS 45.55.070. The sales were effected by an unregistered agent of Nu Life.
13
13. By selling securities that are unregistered, Respondent Nu Life has violated
14
the Act. AS 45.55.920(c) provides for a fine of not more than $500 for a single violation of
15
the Act.
16
14. In selling unregistered securities, Respondent Fisher acted as an
17
unregistered agent making sales of unregistered securities. AS 45.55.920(c) provides for a
18
fine of not more than $500 for a single violation of the Act.
19
15. In using a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, Nu Life has violated the Act.
20
AS 45.55.920(c) provides for a fine of not more than $500 for a single violation of the Act.

ORDER AND CIVIL FINE
2
16. Under AS 45.55.920(a)(1), based on the facts alleged in this Order, the
3
Administrator finds that Respondent Nu Life and Respondent Fisher have engaged in
4
violations of the Alaska Securities Act and that it is in the public interest to issue this Order.
5
17. Under AS 45.55.920(a)(1)(A), Respondent Nu Life and Respondent Fisher
6
are ordered to cease and desist from selling unregistered securities and from all other
7
unlawful acts and practices. Respondents are also ordered to cease and desist from any
8
future violation of the Alaska Securities Act.
9
18. Under AS 45.55.920(c), Respondent Nu Life is fined $500 for each violation
10
of AS 45.55.010, AS 45.55.030, and AS 45.55.070, for a total fine of $1,500.
11
19. Under AS 45.55.920(c), Respondent Fisher is fined $500 for each violation of
12
AS 45.55.010, AS 45.55.030, and AS 45.55.070, for a total fine of $1,500.
13
20. Under AS 45.55.920(d), this Cease and Desist Order is made the Final Order
14
of the Administrator as no hearing under 3 AAC 08.930(a) was requested within 15 days
15
after receipt of the Temporary Order that was served on the Respondents on July 18, 2001.

FINAL ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST
AND TO IMPOSE CIVIL FINE
11
12
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
13
1. The Division of Banking, Securities, and Corporations (division) within the
14
Department of Community and Economic Development is charged with enforcement of the
15
Alaska Securities Act (Act).
16
2. Respondent Coastal Resources Corporation (Coastal Resources) is a
17
California corporation, whose mailing address is 33971 Selva Road, Suite 230, Dana Point
18
CA 92629 and whose alternate address is 16 Technology, #130, Irvine, CA 92616.
19
Respondent Richard F. O'Connor (O'Connor) is the corporation's president and chief
20
executive officer whose business address is the same as the corporation. Respondent
21
Rose Conant (Conant) is the corporate secretary whose business address is the same as
22
the corporation.
23
3. A corporation wishing to sell securities in Alaska must be registered under AS
24
45.55.070 or receive an exemption under AS 45.55.900 before any sales can be made.
25
4. JG of Anchorage is an Alaskan purchaser of Coastal Resource stock.
ALASKA ORDER # 02-01 S
Page 1
VI
1
5. Some time during the summer of 2000, KK, an acquaintance of JG, told JG o
2
the existence of Coastal Resources and recommended he buy the stock. He placed JG in
3
touch with O'Connor in order to make the purchase.
4
6. On September 7, 2000, JG paid to Coastal Resources $50,000 by personal
5
check made out to a bank in California. On November 16, 2000, JG sent another check in
6
the amount of $10,000 made payable personally to Rose Conant. JG received stock
7
certificates confirming his purchases signed by O'Connor and Conant. These are
8
certificate 209 dated September 8, 2000 for 50,000 shares and certificate 276 dated
9
November 16, 2000 for 10,000 shares.
10
7. A search of division records reveals no registration or exemption applied for
11
by Coastal Resources Corporation.
12
8. A search of the internet revealed a listing for Richard F. O'Connor, consisting
13
of a press release reporting a cease and desist Order issued by the Pennsylvania
14
Securities Commission in October 1999. A telephone check with Pennsylvania determined
15
that there had been no response whatsoever to the Order. There were no regular
16
registrations for Richard F. O'Connor or for Rose Conant.
17
9. On the web site for Coastal Resources Corporation (reachable at the URL
18
Ittp://www.coastalresourcesinc.com/), there is biographical information on Mr. O'Connor
19
containing the following:
20
""Mr. O'Connor has extensive marketing experience in developing and
assisting small to mid-size companies in private placement funding,
21
as well as assisting companies in the process of going public.'
22
Thus, Mr. O'Connor has experience in the field of securities, and should have known that
23
registration or exemption was required for the securities and that any person selling
24
securities has to be registered as an agent.
25
10. The division made repeated calls to Richard O'Connor and the other
ALASKA ORDER # 02-01 S
Page 2
VIL
1
Respondent and despite assurances that he would return calls, none ever were. It thus
2
became necessary to issue the Temporary Order without notice to the Respondents.
3
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
4
11. Two sales of unregistered securities took place in Alaska in violation of
5
AS 45.55.070. Because of O'Connor's purported experience in the field and because there
6
was a prior order from Pennsylvania on the same issue, these sales were made with
7
knowledge of their illegality.
8
12. Sales were effected by unregistered individuals acting as agents in violation
9
of AS 45.55.030. Because of O'Connor's purported experience and because there was a
10
prior order from Pennsylvania on the same issue, these sales were made with knowledge
11
that the offerings were required to have either registration or exemption as required by
12
AS 45.55.030.
13
13. Respondent O'Connor and Respondent Coastal Resources are deemed
to
14
have made knowing, intentional sales of unregistered securities by unregistered persons by
15
virtue of O'Connor's purported experience in securities matters, which experience is
16
attributed to the corporation as O'Connor serves as its president and CEO.
17
14. By virtue of not disclosing the existence of the 1999 Pennsylvania Order,
18
Respondents Coastal Resources, O'Connor, and Conant have perpetrated a fraud in
19
violation of AS 45.55.010.
20
15. Because JG was directed to make his check out to Rose Conant person-
21
ally and did, Respondent Conant perpetrated a fraud on JG, in violation of AS 45.55.010.

under the Alaska Securities Act with respect to this administrative Consent Order (the ""Order"");
7
NOW, THEREFORE, the division, as administrator of the Alaska Securities Act (Act),
hereby enters this Order:
8
I. FINDINGS OF FACT
9
A. Summary and Jurisdiction
10
1. Citigroup Global is, and under its former name SSB was, at all relevant times, a registered
11
broker-dealer with its principal place of business located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, Nev
York 10013. SSB has engaged and Citigroup Global continues to be engaged, in a full-service
12
securities business, including institutional and retail sales, investment banking services, trading
and research.
13
2. The division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Act.
14
3. In 1999, 2000, and 2001 (the ""relevant period""), as described below, SSB issued research
15
reports on two telecommunications (""telecom"") companies that were fraudulent and issued
research reports on several telecom companies that were misleading.
16
4. During the relevant period, SSB employed business practices that required research analysts
to promote SSB's investment banking efforts. Research alone did not generate substantial profit
17
for SSB; investment banking did, and it needed the services of research analysts to do so.
Research analysts were expected to vet prospective investment banking deals, promote SSB's
18
investment banking business to issuers during pitches, and market investment banking deals to
SSB's customers. When SSB secured investment banking business, research analysts were
19
expected to provide favorable coverage of SSB's investment banking clients. Important factors i
evaluating an analyst's performance and determining an analyst's compensation at SSB were
20
investment banker evaluations and investment banking revenues generated in an analyst's secto
These business practices created a culture in which investment bankers could and did pressure
21
research analysts to maintain coverage or favorable ratings for investment banking clients and
created the incentive for analysts to use research to obtain, retain and increase revenue from
22
investment banking deals. SSB failed to manage the conflicts created by its practices.
23
5. Jack Grubman was the linchpin for SSB's investment banking efforts in the telecom sector.
was the preeminent telecom analyst in the industry, and telecom was of critical importance to SS
His approval and favorable view were important for SSB to obtain investment banking business
24
from telecom companies in his sector. In total, SSB earned more than $790 million in investmer
banking revenue during the relevant period from telecom companies Grubman covered. Given
25
Grubman's key role in SSB's investment banking success in the telecom sector, SSB compensa
him handsomely. During the relevant period, Grubman was one of the most highly paid researc
1
analysts at SSB and on Wall Street. Between 1999 and August 2002, when he left the firm,
Grubman's total compensation exceeded $67.5 million, including his multi-million dollar severance
2
package.
3
6. During the relevant period, SSB and Grubman published fraudulent research reports on Focal
Communications and Metromedia Fiber Networks, as set forth below. These reports were contrary
4
to the true views Grubman and another analyst on his team privately expressed, presented an
optimistic picture that overlooked and minimized the risk of investing in these companies, predicted
5
substantial growth in the companies' revenues and earnings without a reasonable basis, did not
disclose material facts about these companies, and contained material misstatements about the
companies.
6
7. Moreover, SSB and Grubman also published certain research reports that were misleading. In
7
April 2001, Grubman expressed a need to downgrade six telecom companies (Level 3
Communications, Williams Communications Group, XO Communications, Focal, Adelphia
8
Business Solutions, and RCN Communications). Investment bankers pressured Grubman not to
downgrade these companies and Grubman did not. He continued to advise investors to buy these
9
stocks, and did not disclose the influence of investment bankers on his ratings. In addition, a
research report on Williams Communications lacked a reasonable basis because it did not disclose
10
the true views Grubman and others on his team privately expressed at the same time about the
company and certain research reports on Focal failed to disclose facts as described below.
11
8. In November 1999, Grubman upgraded AT&T from a Neutral (3) - his longtime rating on the
12
stock -- to a Buy (1). SSB and Grubman did not disclose in the report that Grubman had a conflict
of interest relating to his evaluation of AT&T. Prior to the upgrade, Sanford I. Weill (""Weill""), the co-
13
CEO and Chairman of Citigroup (and a member of the AT&T board of directors), had asked
Grubman to take a ""fresh look"" at AT&T, and Grubman had asked Weill for assistance in gaining
admission for his children to the selective 92nd Street Y preschool in New York City at the same
14
time Grubman was conducting his ""fresh look"" at the company. Subsequently, Grubman stated
privately that he had upgraded AT&T to help his children get into the 92nd Street Y preschool.
15
After Grubman upgraded AT&T and his children were admitted to the preschool, Weill arranged a
pledge of $1 million payable in equal amounts over five years from Citigroup to the 92nd Street Y.
16
9. Grubman's upgrade of AT&T also helped SSB gain investment banking business from AT&T.
17
In late fall 1999, AT&T determined to make an initial public offering (""IPO"") of a tracking stock for its
wireless unit - the largest equity offering in the United States. In February 2000, AT&T named
18
SSB as one of the lead underwriters and joint book-runners for the IPO, in large part because of
Grubman's ""strong buy"" rating of, and ""strong support"" for, AT&T. SSB earned $63 million in
19
investment banking fees from this engagement.
20
10. During the period 1996 through 2000, SSB engaged in improper spinning practices by
allocating hot IPO shares² to executives of current or potential investment banking clients and
21
providing special treatment for these executives. The executives profited significantly from selling
IPO stock allocated to them. The investment banking business generated by the firms for which
these executives worked represented a substantial portion of SSB's revenues during this period.
22
11. Additionally, SSB failed to maintain books and records sufficient to determine whether or not
23
the distribution of IPO shares had been completed prior to the initiation of secondary market
trading. Further, SSB failed to administer Issuer Directed Share Programs appropriately and failed
24
25
2
A ""hot IPO"" is one that trades at a premium in the secondary market whenever trading in the
secondary market begins.
1
to establish and maintain written supervisory procedures for the appropriate management of such
programs.
2
B. SSB Failed to Manage Conflicts of Interest Between Research and Investment Banking
3
13. SSB's business practices intertwined research with investment banking, thus creating the
4
vehicle for investment banking to exert inappropriate influence over research analysts. SSB failed
to manage the resulting conflicts of interest in an adequate or appropriate manner.
5
1. SSB's Business Practices Required Research Analysts to Support Investment
Bankers
6
14. Companies paid SSB's investment bankers to assist them with (a) capital raising activities such
7
as IPOs, ""follow on"" offerings (subsequent offerings of stock to the public), and private placements
of stock, and (b) other corporate transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions. During the
8
relevant period, investment banking was an important source of revenue for SSB; revenues from
investment banking grew from approximately $3.0 billion in 1999, to approximately $3.6 billion in
9
2000, and to approximately $3.9 billion in 2001. Investment banking fees comprised over 21% of
SSB's revenue in 1999, over 22% in 2000, and over 25% in 2001.
10
15. SSB's equity research analysts provided SSB's investing clients and the public with research
11
reports on certain public companies. SSB held out its research analysts as providing independent,
objective and unbiased information, reports, ratings, and recommendations upon which investors
12
could rely in reaching investment decisions. SSB distributed its analysts' reports to its clients
directly and by placing the reports on ils website.
13
16. At SSB, research was a cost center. In contrast, investment banking generated substantial
profits for SSB. To leverage its research, SSB required research analysts to serve, among others,
14
investment banking. Accordingly,
SSB expected research analysts to prepare business plans each year that, among
15
other things, highlighted what the research analysts had done and would do to help
SSB's investment bankers;
16
SSB's research analysts were encouraged to develop investment banking business
from issuers and private companies in their sectors;
17
SSB's research analysts were expected to support investment banking by pitching
business to prospective clients and marketing investment banking deals to
18
institutional customers through roadshows;
Investment banking concerns sometimes affected research analysts' decisions to
19
initiate coverage, rate companies, and drop coverage. SSB's research analysts
were generally expected to initiate coverage of SSB's investment banking clients
20
with favorable ratings;
Investment bankers reviewed the performance of the principal research analysts in
21
their sector as part of the analysts' annual review; and
Investment banking revenue generated in an analyst's sector and attributable to an
22
analyst was an important factor SSB used to evaluate an analyst's performance and
determine an analyst's compensation.
23
17. This integration of research analysts with investment banking was an SSB objective. In a
24
January 1998 presentation to senior management at Travelers Corporation, then the parent of
SSB, the head of SSB wrote: ""There is a continuing shift in the realization that an analyst is the
25
key element in banking success."" Underscoring the same theme two years later, on December 8,
2000, the head of SSB's Global Equity Research wrote to the CEO of SSB that one of his goals
1
since becoming global head of research was ""to better integrate our research product with the
business development plans of our constituencies, particularly investment banking
2
18. In reviewing his performance for 2000, the head of SSB's Global Equity Research stated:
3
We have become much more closely linked to investment banking this year
4
as a result of participating in their much-improved franchise review process
this year. There has been a yearend [sic] cross review of senior analysts
and bankers particularly in the U.S. and Europe and with the development
5
of the Platinum Program in the investment bank, the analyst's
understanding of the relative importance of clients for IB [investment
6
banking] and GRB [global relationship bank] is much improved.
7
19. In January 2000, SSB held a ""Best Practices Seminar"" for research analysts that was hosted
by the head of U.S. Equity Research Management. At that seminar, a senior member of Research
8
Management stated:
9
[W]hen you look at the market share gap between us and the three
competitors who are trying to close. When I just eyeballed it, it looked like to
10
me there is something like roughly a billion dollars of, maybe not Equity
Capital Markets but Investment Banking revenues, on the table for this firm.
11
And that's a lot of money.
And its clear that Research is driving a lot of this increasingly. And
12
therefore, as a [research] department our goal has to be, to be a really
effective partner in terms of helping drive initiation, execution and everything
13
else. Because there is a lot of money on the table for this company. And
we'll all benefit from it.
14
2. SSB Analysts Helped Investment Bankers Identify and Obtain Business
15
20. Research analysts at SSB helped investment banking by identifying prospective clients and
mandates and by participating in sales ""pitches"" for investment banking business. SSB bankers
16
would not pitch for investment banking business unless they knew the SSB analyst who would
cover the company was going to support the proposed deal.
17
21. SSB's pitchbooks to potential investment banking clients routinely highlighted the experience
18
and qualifications of the lead analyst in the company's sector and how the analyst would help
market the proposed deal. During the ""pitch"" process, SSB conveyed that its research analysts
19
would cover the company if the company gave it investment banking business, and analysts
frequently attended the ""pitch"" sessions. Once a company selected SSB as the underwriter, SSB
20
analysts worked together with investment bankers to (among other things) perform due diligence
on the deal and take the company executives out on ""roadshows"" to market the potential
transaction to institutional investors.
21
22
22. During the relevant period, all parties involved - the analyst, the firm, and the issuer -
understood that the analyst would initiate coverage of the company if SSB was given investment
banking business and would initially rate the company favorably.
23
3. SSB's Research Analysts Supported Investment Banking Through Their Ratings
24
and Coverage
25
23. SSB encouraged analysts to support SSB's investment banking business through their ratings.
Each research report SSB issued included an investment rating that purportedly reflected the
analyst's objective opinion of the relative attractiveness of the company to the investors.
1
24. During the relevant time period, SSB advised its customers that it utilized the following five-
point investment rating system:
2
1 Buy
2 - Outperform
3
3 - Neutral
4 - Underperform
5 Sell
4
5
25. In addition, SSB during the relevant period included in each research report a risk rating of L
(low risk), M (moderate risk), H (high risk), S (Speculative), or V (Venture). Each of the research
reports and call notes discussed below, other than those on AT&T, rated the company S
6
(Speculative).
7
26. In practice during the relevant period, SSB's research analysts rarely rated companies a 4
(Underperform) and never a 5 (Sell) in part to avoid antagonizing issuers in a way that would harm
8
SSB's investment banking business. As a Director who provided Research Management Support
stated in a March 30, 2001 e-mail:
9
[WJe in U.S. Research currently have no ""4"" (Underperform) or ""5"" (Sell)
10
ratings. We use neutral rating as a statement that we are not at all
enthusiastic about a stock. That effectively conveys the message that
11
customers should not be in the stock. If we were to use 4 or 5 ratings that
approach would be perceived as highly antagonistic to buy side accounts
12
[and] company management teams.
13
27. In a later e-mail, the same person suggested that the common terms SSB used to rate stocks
did not mean what they said: ""various people in research and media relations are very easy
targets for irate phone calls from clients, reporters, etc. who make a very literal reading of the rating
14
[I]f someone wants to read the ratings system for exactly what it says they have a perfect right
to do that.'
15
28. The head of SSB's Global Equity Research raised the issue of research integrity directly with
16
the head of SSB in a memorandum entitled ""2000 Performance Review,"" when he expressed a
""legitimate concern about the objectivity of our analysts which we must allay in 2001.' The head of
17
Global Equity Research also addressed the nature of the research ratings at an SSB equities
management meeting. He made a presentation regarding the SSB ""Stock Recommendations as of
18
1/29/01,"" which showed that, out of a total of 1179 stock ratings, there were no Sell ratings and
only one Underperform rating. In handwritten notes attached to this presentation, he described
19
these ratings in the U.S. as the ""worst"" and ""ridiculous on face."" He observed that there was a
""rising issue of research integrity"" and a ""basic inherent conflict between IB [investment banking],
20
equities and retail."" In a February 22, 2001 memo, the head of Global Equity Research told the
managing directors in the U.S. equity research division that the global head of SSB's private client
21
(i.e., retail) division said SSB's ""research was basically worthless"" and threatened to terminate his
division's contribution to the research budget.
22
29. SSB did not change its rating system, however, and the de facto three-category rating system
remained in place throughout 2001. As of the end of 2001, SSB covered over 1000 U.S. stocks
23
but had no Sell ratings and only 15 Underperform ratings (1.4%).
24
4. Investment Banking Influenced SSB's Evaluation and Compensation of Research
Analysts
25
30. SSB established a compensation structure that linked research analysts with investment
banking. Research analysts were requested to draft business plans that discussed, among other
1
things, their steps to support investment banking business in the past year and their plans to
support investment banking in the upcoming year.
2
31. In addition, investment bankers among others evaluated the performance of research analysts.
3
Bonuses for research analysts - comprising most of their compensation - were tied to several
factors, one of the most important of which was the investment banking revenue SSB attributed to
4
the research analyst.
C.
Grubman Supported SSB's Investment Banking Business in the Telecom Sector
5
32. During the relevant period, Grubman was one of the most prominent analysts on Wall Street.
6
He was a Managing Director of SSB, and the preeminent research analyst at SSB. He managed a
team of analysts who issued research reports (""Reports"") and call notes (""Notes) on telecom
7
companies. Grubman was principally responsible for each Report and Note SSB issued on these
companies.
8
(1) Grubman Helped Obtain Investment Banking Clients for SSB
9
33. Grubman helped to obtain and maintain business for SSB's investment bankers from telecom
10
companies in his sector. Grubman also vetted proposed transactions involving telecom companies
and vetoed those he could not view favorably. Once he determined he could support a proposed
11
transaction, he and other telecom analysts who reported to him often participated in pitching the
potential client to award SSB investment banking business and in roadshows that marketed
12
offerings to investors.
(2) Grubman's Ratings Assisted SSB's Investment Banking Business
13
34. During the relevant period, SSB was the lead underwriter on 6 IPOs for telecom companies.
14
For each company, Grubman initiated coverage with a 1 (Buy) recommendation. In virtually every
instance, Grubman also issued favorable research reports on telecom companies for which SSB
15
acted as lead or co-manager of a secondary offering of equity stock offering. In fact, Grubman and
his group, with only one exception, did not rate a stock a 4 during the relevant period and never
16
rated a stock a 5. Rather, he and the research personnel who reported to him would drop
coverage altogether rather than rate a stock at less than a Neutral.
17
(3) Grubman Helped Generate Substantial Revenue for SSB's Investment
18
Banking Department and Was Highly Compensated
19
35. Grubman's efforts contributed to the telecom sector generating substantial investment banking
revenue for SSB. During the relevant period, as reflected in documents prepared in connection
20
with Grubman's evaluation and compensation, SSB earned more than $790 million in total gross
investment banking fees from telecom companies covered by Grubman: approximately $359
million in 1999, $331 million in 2000, and $101 million in 2001.
21
36. Grubman was well paid for his efforts. During the relevant period, he was one of the most
22
highly compensated research analysts at SSB. His total compensation (including deferred
compensation) from 1999-2001 exceeded $48 million: over $22 million in 1999, over $20.2 million
23
in 2000, and over $6.5 million in 2001. In light of the importance investment banking played in
SSB's annual evaluations, Grubman and two of his assistants in their 2001 performance evaluation
24
highlighted the investment banking deals for which they had been responsible.
25
37. As was true of other research analysts, Grubman was evaluated by investment bankers,
institutional sales, and retail sales. Grubman received high scores and evaluations from
1
investment bankers in 2000 and 2001 that reflected his importance to investment banking.
Investment bankers rated analysts on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). For 2000, Grubman
2
received a 5 rating overall from investment bankers, who ranked him first among all analysts. His
ratings and rankings in specific investment banking categories, such as pre-marketing, marketing,
3
and follow-up were also at the top levels. For 2001, Grubman's average score (the only score
presented that year) from investment bankers was 4.382, ranking him 23rd among the 98 analysts
4
reviewed.
38. SSB's institutional sales force rated Grubman 16th out of 113 analysts in 2000 and 46th out of
5
115 analysts in 2001.
6
39. Retail brokers ranked analysts on a scale from - -1 (lowest) to 2 (highest). For 1999, the retail
sales force gave Grubman an average score of 1.59, ranking him 4th out of 159 analysts evaluated.
7
In contrast, for 2000 and 2001, Grubman's evaluations from retail were dramatically lower and well
below his scores from investment bankers and the institutional sales force in both years. In 2000,
8
retail ranked Grubman last among all analysts with a score of -0.64. The same was true for 2001 -
- the retail force ranked Grubman last among all analysts reviewed, and his score fell to -0.906.
9
40. Moreover, Grubman received scathing written evaluations from the retail sales force in 2000
10
and 2001. Hundreds of retail sales people sent negative written evaluations of Grubman in both
years.
11
Many claimed Grubman had a conflict of interest between his role as an analyst and his
role assisting investment banking:
12
""poster child for conspicuous conflicts of interest"";
""I hope Smith Barney enjoyed the investment banking fees he generated,
13
because they come at the expense of the retail clients"";
""Let him be a banker, not a research analyst"";
14
""His opinions are completely tainted by investment banking' relationships
(padding his business)"";
""Investment banker, or research analyst? He should be fired"";
15
""Grubman has made a fortune for himself personally and for the investment
banking division. However, his investment recommendations have
16
impoverished the portfolio of my clients and I have had to spend endless hours
with my clients discussing the losses Grubman has caused them.""
17
Many criticized his support of companies that were SSB investment banking clients:
""Grubman's analysis and recommendations to buy (1 Ranking) WCOM
18
[Worldcom], GX [Global Crossing], Q [Qwest] is/was careless"";
""His ridiculously bullish calls on WCOM and GX cost our clients a lot of
19
money"";
""How can an analyst be so wrong and still keep his job? RTHM [Rhythm
20
NetConnections], WCOM, etc., etc."";
""Downgrading a stock at $1/sh is useless to us.""
21
""How many bombs do we tolerate before we totally lose credibility with
clients?
22
41. The evaluations and comments from retail did not appear to affect Grubman. In a January
23
2001 e-mail, he stated:
I
24
never much worry about review. For example, this year I was rated
last by retail (actually had a negative score) thanks to T [AT&T] and
carnage in new names. As the global head of research was
25
haranguing me about this I asked him if he thought Sandy [Weill]
liked $300 million in trading commission and $400 million (only my
1
direct credit not counting things like NTT [Nippon Telecom] or KPN
[KPN Qwest] our total telecom was over $600 million) in banking
2
revenues. So, grin and bear it.
3
42. When Grubman left SSB in August 2002, he signed a separation agreement that included
compensation worth approximately $19.5 million plus approximately $13 million in deferred
4
compensation previously accrued in 1999, 2000, and 2001.
D.
5
Investment Bankers Successfully Pressured Grubman to Maintain Positive Ratings
on Stocks
6
43. Investment bankers pressured Grubman to maintain positive ratings on companies in part to
avoid angering the covered companies and causing them to take their investment banking
7
business elsewhere.
8
44. On April 18, 2001, one of the companies Grubman covered, Winstar Communications, Inc. (a
Competitive Local Exchange Carrier or CLEC), declared bankruptcy. In the aftermath of the
9
Winstar bankruptcy, an SSB investment banker suggested that SSB's telecom investment bankers
and research analysts have a conference call followed by a meeting to consider the prospects of
10
other CLECs and similar telecom companies. Grubman agreed, but made clear that the Winstar
bankruptcy had convinced him of the need to downgrade other CLECs and telecom companies, all
11
of which he rated a Buy (1) at the time:
12
Also to be blunt we in research have to downgrade stocks lest our
retail force (which Sandy cares about a lot which I know to [sic] well)
13
end up having buy rated stocks that go under. So part of this call will
be our view that LVLT [Level 3], WCG [Williams Communication
Group], XOXO [XO Communications], FCOM [Focal], ABIZ [Adelphia
14
Business Solutions), RCN [RCN Communications] must not remain
buys.
15
45. Thereafter, the then-head of investment banking for SSB and the head of telecom investment
16
banking called Grubman separately. The head of investment banking told him not to downgrade
the stocks because doing so would anger these companies and hurt SSB's investment banking
17
business. The head of telecom investment banking told him that they should discuss his proposed
downgrades because some of the names were more sensitive than others. SSB and Grubman did
18
not downgrade these stocks until months thereafter, continued to advise investors to buy these
stocks and, in the weeks and months following, merely lowered the target prices for each of these
19
companies.
20
46. Grubman acknowledged that investment banking influenced his publicly expressed views about
the companies he covered. He stated in a May 2001 e-mail to an analyst who reported to him:
21
If anything the record shows we support our banking clients too
22
well and for too long.
47. The analyst agreed and stated that Grubman had helped SSB's investment banking business
23
by using his influence to sell securities for questionable companies:
24
I told [an investment banker] that you get the good and the bad
with you [Grubman] and to look at all the bad deals we sold for them
25
in the past. He agreed.
1
48. On May 31, 2001, Merrill Lynch downgraded XO, one of the stocks Grubman had wanted to
downgrade in April. Merrill's actions caused Grubman to consider again whether he should have
2
downgraded XO:
3
Another one. / hope we were not wrong in not downgrading. Try to
talk to folks to see what they think of these downgrades. Maybe we
should have done like / wanted to. Now it's too late. (Emphasis
4
added.)
5
49. A research analyst who reported to Grubman responded to this e-mail by reiterating a negative
view of XO and Level 3:
6
XOXO is a lost cause, its [sic] never too late to do the call, we
7
could downgrade XO, LVLT, etc.
8
50. Later the same day, the same analyst e-mailed Grubman, warning him that an institutional
investor thought downgrading XO would:
9
definitely get the Lame-O award on CNBC & wouldn't help anyone
10
out, it would just call attention to our negligence on not downgrading
sooner.
11
51. A few weeks later, Grubman was invited to a dinner with the head of U.S. Equity Research and
two senior investment bankers. Grubman anticipated discussing banking's displeasure with his
12
commentary on telecom stocks. Grubman e-mailed one of his research colleagues:
13
I have dinner with [a senior investment banker and the head of
U.S. Equity Research] I bet to discuss banking's displeasure with our
14
commentary on some names. Screw [the investment bankers]. We
should have put a Sell on everything a year ago. (Emphasis added.)
15
52. The next day, Grubman e-mailed the head of U.S. Equity Research, stating that the pressure
16
from investment banking had caused him not to downgrade stocks he covered:
17
See you at dinner. If [a senior investment banker] starts up I will lace
into him
most of our banking clients are going to zero and you
18
know I wanted to downgrade them months ago but got huge
pushback from banking.
19
53. SSB and Grubman maintained Buy ratings on Level 3, WCG, XO, RCN, Adelphia, and Focal
20
for months after April 2001. SSB and Grubman did not downgrade Level 3 until June 18, 2001;
RCN until August 2, 2001; Focal and Adelphia until August 13, 2001; and WCG and XO until
November 1, 2001. In each instance, SSB downgraded these stocks to a 3 (Neutral). None of the
21
Notes published between April 18 and the date of each downgrade disclosed the pressure
investment bankers had exerted on Grubman and Grubman's yielding to such pressure. These
22
Notes were inconsistent with the views Grubman had expressed, as reflected in the emails above,
concerning these stocks.
23
E.
SSB and Grubman Published Fraudulent Research That Promoted Focal
24
Communications and Metromedia Fiber, Two of SSB's Investment Banking Clients
25
54. SSB and Grubman published certain fraudulent research reports on Focal Communications
and Metromedia Fiber, two investment banking clients of SSB. As described below, certain
1
research reports on these companies were contrary to Grubman's private views and those of his
team. Moreover, certain research reports on these two companies presented an optimistic picture
2
that overlooked or minimized the risk of investing in these companies and predicted substantial
growth in the companies' revenues and earnings without a reasonable basis.

1. SSB and Grubman Published Fraudulent Research Reports on Focal
4
55. Focal was a CLEC - a broadband telecommunications provider of limited reach. As of
December 31, 1999 it operated in 16 locations nationwide and as of December 31, 2000 it
5
operated in 20 locations nationwide. Focal was never profitable. Focal's net loss was
approximately $500,000 in 1996, $3 million in 1997, $8 million in 1998, $22 million in 1999, and
6
$105 million in 2000.
7
56. Focal was an investment banking client for SSB. SSB underwrote Focal's initial public offering
in July 1999. It also assisted the company in other investment banking transactions. In total, SSB
8
earned approximately $11.8 million in investment banking fees from Focal.
9
57. Shortly after SSB underwrote Focal's initial public offering, it initiated coverage with a Buy (1)
rating and maintained that rating until August 12, 2001. Grubman was responsible for SSB's
10
Reports and Notes on the company.
11
58. SSB and Grubman published two Notes on Focal that were fraudulent - one issued on
February 21, 2001 and one issued on April 30, 2001. The February 21 Note ""reiterated"" a Buy
12
recommendation. It left the target price unchanged from $30 (approximately twice the stock price
of $15.50). The Note reported overall results that were ""in line"" with expectations, and a revenue
13
mix that ""continues to improve."" It also reported that Focal ""continues to gain a stronger foothold in
the large business market and continues to grow sales of existing customers with existing and new
products and also into multiple markets."" The February 21 Note reported EBITDA (earnings before
14
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) that improved over the previous quarter and was in
line with estimates; it advised investors that Focal expected to be EBITDA breakeven sometime in
15
2001. Finally, the Note thought the company could continue to perform well and grow and, if it did
the target price and estimates would be increased:
16
The quarter's results were in line with our expectations. The revenue
17
and line mix is improving but the fact remains that FCOM still has
exposure to recip comp and exposure to ISPs, which are areas of
18
concern for investors. While FCOM is collecting recip comp and is
good at reviewing its customer credit profiles with ISPs, which are
19
areas of concern for investors, we believe it is prudent to see a few
more quarters of good execution and growth before we change
20
numbers. We continue to remain prudent and thus, we don't think we
should raise our price target to above $30 when the stock is only
21
trading at $15. But, as we stated in our 3Q note, if [Focal]
management continues to execute and also delivers on its data
strategy, we believe this will be reflected in its stock price, and thus,
22
we will be in a better position to raise numbers.
23
59. The same day as the February 21 Note, however, Grubman stated that he believed Focal
should be rated an Underperform (4) rather than a Buy(1), that ""every single smart buysider""
24
believed its stock price was going to zero, and that the company was a ""pig."" Focal apparently
complained about the February 21 Note. When Grubman heard of the complaint, he e-mailed tw
25
investment bankers:
1
I hear company complained about our note. I did too. I screamed at
[the analyst] for saying ""reiterate buy."" If I so much as hear one more
2
fucking peep out of them we will put the proper rating (ie 4 not even
3) on this stock which every single smart buysider feels is going to
3
zero. We lose credibility on MCLD and XO because we support pigs
like Focal.
4
60. Also on February 21, an institutional investor e-mailed a research analyst who worked for
Grubman, ""Mcld [McLeod USA, Inc.] and Focal are pigs aren't they?"" and asked whether Focal
5
was ""a short."" The analyst responded to the e-mail: ""Focal definitely
""
6
61. Grubman continued to express his true view of Focal in a subsequent communication. As
described in Section D above, he stated on April 18, 2001 that the company needed to be
7
downgraded in the aftermath of the Winstar bankruptcy.
I
8
62. Contrary to these negative views of Grubman and his colleague, the April 30 Note on Focal
again advised investors to buy Focal. By April 30, the stock price had fallen to $6.48. Although the
9
April 30 Note lowered the target price to $15, calling the previous target price of $30 ""stale,"" the
new target price was still more than twice the stock price. The April 30 Note stated that the
10
company had reported quarterly results in line with estimates, repeated that Focal's ""revenue mix is
improving towards telecom,"" and noted the ""line mix"" continued to improve.
11
63. Neither the February 21 Note nor the April 30 Note disclosed the actual views of Grubman and
12
his colleague about Focal. Indeed, both Notes contradicted such views. Neither Note described
the company as a 'pig' or a ""short,"" disclosed that ""smart buysiders"" were predicting that Focal's
13
stock price was going to zero, or indicated that the proper rating for Focal was an Underperform
(4). The February 21 Note and the April 30 Note did not provide any other reason the stock should
be downgraded. To the contrary, both Notes advised investors to buy the stock, predicted that the
14
company's stock price could at least double over the next 12 to 18 months, and indicated that the
company's numbers were ""in line"" and in some respects improving. Accordingly, the Notes issued
15
on February 21, 2001 and April 30, 2001 were fraudulent.
16
2.
SSB and Grubman Issued Fraudulent Research Reports on Metromedia Fiber
17
64. Metromedia Fiber built and operated fiber optic systems nationally and in Europe. It intended
to provide telecom services to CLECs and large telecom companies, cable companies, internet
18
service providers, and Fortune 500 companies in large metropolitan areas. As of the end of 2000,
Metromedia Fiber was increasingly unprofitable, spent substantial amounts of cash to construct its
19
fiber optic systems and required even more capital to complete its planned network.
20
65. Metromedia Fiber was an investment banking client for SSB. SSB underwrote Metromedia
Fiber's IPO in 1997 and a secondary offering in November 1999. In addition, SSB engaged in
21
other investment banking transactions for the company. In total, SSB earned approximately $49
million in investment banking fees in Metromedia Fiber deals. After Metromedia Fiber's IPO, SSB
22
and Grubman initiated coverage of the company with a Buy (1) rating and maintained that rating
until July 25, 2001.
23
66. In 2001, the company entered into an agreement with Citicorp USA, Inc. (an SSB affiliate) to
provide it with a credit facility that it needed to fund its operations. The deadline for closing on the
24
facility was extended twice and, in the end, the facility was completed for less than half its full
amount. The Notes on Metromedia Fiber issued between April 2001 and July 2001 did not
25
adequately disclose the red flags concerning the credit facility or Grubman's view that the company
might not get the funding. Moreover, in June 2001, a research analyst working for Grubman told
1
him that while the company had funds through the end of 2001, thereafter the company's
fundamentals would deteriorate. This contradicted the ratings and price targets SSB and Grubmi
2
published on the stock in a Note dated June 28, 2001. For these reasons, the Notes dated April
30, 2001, June 6, 2001, and June 28, 2001 were fraudulent and misleading.
3
67. Metromedia Fiber announced on January 8, 2001 that it had ""obtained a commitment for a fu
underwritten credit facility for $350 million from Citicorp USA, Inc., which it expects will fully fund
4
current business plan of building 3.6 million fiber miles
by the end of 2004.""
5
68. As of March 2001, Metromedia Fiber faced a risk of not obtaining financing for its operations,
had
sufficient
funds
for
its
operations
through
the
end
of
2001,
and
may
not
have
had
sources
fc
6
additional capital to finance its operations after the end of 2001. In particular, the company state
at the time that it may not be able to close on the pending $350 million credit facility from Citicorp
7
USA.
8
69. In an April 18, 2001 e-mail to a senior investment banker, Grubman indicated he was aware
that Metromedia Fiber might not close the credit facility and would downgrade the company shot
9
it not obtain the additional funding: ""If MFNX [Metromedia Fiber] does not get credit facility they
too get downgraded [from a buy].""
10
70. Nevertheless, on April 30, 2001, SSB and Grubman issued a Note that reiterated a Buy (1)
11
rating for Metromedia Fiber, stating: ""We want to make it very clear that [Metromedia Fiber]
remains one of our favorite names.' Regarding funding for the company, the Note stated:
12
As noted in our previous note, MFN has obtained a commitment for a
13
fully underwritten credit facility for $350 million from Citicorp USA,
Inc., which it expects will fully fund its current business plan
14
71. The April 30 Note failed to disclose that the company believed it might not consummate the
credit facility and that Grubman had expressed doubt that the company might get funding.
15
72. Metromedia Fiber subsequently announced that the deadline for closing on the credit facility
16
had been extended from May 15 to June 30, 2001.
17
73. In a June 6, 2001 Note, SSB and Grubman continued to state that the stock was ""exception.
inexpensive"" and opined that the company had ""good visibility in its core fiber business."" Grubn
18
began and ended the Note with: ""We strongly reiterate our Buy and we would be aggressivi
current prices.' Regarding the funding for the company, Grubman wrote:
19
We continue to believe the $350 million bank loan, which will bring MFNX to fully-
20
funded status, will close by the end of June.
The lack of available capital for MFNX-lookalikes only strengthens MFNX's positi
21
Most recently private companies, such as OnFiber and other metro builders, have
failed in getting private financing and other companies in the metro space have an
22
extremely difficult time,
23
MFNX has a business plan that is fully funded and many ""would-be"" competitors al
never getting to the market.
24
74. The Note did not disclose that (a) the deadline for consummating the bank loan had been
25
extended from May 15 to the end of June; or (b) after announcing the funding commitment, the
company had determined that it may not be able to successfully consummate the senior credit
1
facilities. The Note also did not reflect Grubman's opinion that Metromedia Fiber might not secure
the financing. As described above, the Note emphasized and recognized the importance of
2
Metromedia Fiber's fully-funded position.
3
75. In its June 28, 2001 Note, two days before the expiration of the funding commitment, SSB and
Grubman disclosed that Metromedia Fiber had not consummated the bank loan and that the
4
deadline had been extended from May 15 to June 30. SSB and Grubman minimized the funding
problem by advising investors that the company had other options for financing, but added that
they ""can only guess on the nature or terms of the alternative financing [Metromedia Fiber] would
5
agree to."" Nevertheless, the Note analyzed the company's financing needs assuming the
company could secure the $350 million in additional funds under the loan or by other means and
6
therefore would be fully funded through 2003. The Note continued to project a positive EBITDA for
2003 and reiterated its Buy (1) rating.
7
76. The Notes published from April to July 2001 on Metromedia Fiber minimized the risks facing
8
the company, assumed the company was going to be fully funded, and estimated that the company
would enjoy explosive growth in revenues and earnings. The $25 price target issued on April 30,
9
2001 assumed that the company would have estimated revenue in 2010 of $10.6 billion and
EBITDA of $4.4 billion. The June 6, 2001 target price of $15 assumed the company would have
10
$8.7 billion in revenue nine years out and EBITDA of $3.2 billion. The June 28, 2001 target price
of $10 maintained the estimate of future revenue and EBITDA.
11
77. These reports, and the ratings and price targets included in them, reflected SSB's and
12
Grubman's publicly expressed opinion that the company's future was secure. This view was
contrary to the actual views of SSB's analysts, which were expressed privately and not disclosed.
13
On June 21, 2001, a research analyst who reported to Grubman discounted the prospects of the
company, telling Grubman in an e-mail that while the company had funding thrbugh the end of
2001, its fundamentals would deteriorate thereafter:
14
I have received over 50 calls today on MFNX (its down $0.20 again
15
to $1.51)
Most people have written off this stock saying that it will
go bankrupt, even if they could get an equity infusion here it would be
16
massively dilutive. At lease [sic] they have some cash through the
end of the year but l doubt the fundamentals recover which is actually
17
the important thing. I think downgrading right now is not advisable
since everyone would say ""gee thanks."" I think we need an exuse
18
[sic] from the company, we should have done it the day they lowered
guidance but of course we were restricted.
19
78. SSB did not downgrade Metromedia Fiber until July 25, 2001 and even then only downgraded
20
the stock to a Neutral (3) rating. By then, the company's stock price had sunk to 98 cents, more
than a 33 percent drop from its price on June 21, 2001, when the analyst who reported to Grubman
21
disparaged the company's future.
F.
SSB Issued Misleading Research Reports on Level 3, Focal, RCN, Adelphia, WCG,
22
and XO
23
79. Research reports must not contain misleading statements, analysts must have a reasonable
basis for their recommendations, and reports must present a fair, balanced picture of the risks and
24
benefits of investing in the covered companies and avoid exaggerated or unwarranted claims
regarding the covered companies. As described below, certain research reports issued on Level 3,
25
Focal, RCN, Adelphia, WCG, and XO violated these requirements.
1
1. SSB Issued Misleading Research on Focal
2
80. As stated above, on February 21, 2001 and April 30, 2001, SSB and Grubman published
fraudulent research reports on Focal. In addition to those reports, SSB and Grubman published
3
four misleading research reports on Focal, dated April 10, 2000, April 18, 2000, April 26, 2000, and
July 31, 2000.
4
81. In April 2000, Focal selected SSB to be the joint book runner for a secondary offering of its
5
stock. Focal also announced a major expansion of its business plan. At the time, the company
had significant capital expenditures and required additional capital to complete its new business
plan. It faced the risks that it could not raise such capital and could not complete its new plan, and
6
that, because of its capital expenditures, it would potentially have substantial negative operating
cash flow and substantial net operating losses for the foreseeable future, including through 2000
7
and 2001. Nevertheless, the Notes SSB and Grubman published on April 10, 2000, April 18, 2000,
April 26, 2000, and July 31, 2000 either did not disclose these risks or did not fully address them.
8 In addition, these Notes published a target price that did not have a reasonable basis.
9
82. On April 10, 2000 SSB and Grubman issued a Note that reiterated a Buy (1) recommendation
on Focal and increased the target price for Focal from $60 to $110. The Note discussed Focal's
10
planned expansion, describing it as ""sexy"" and ""providing the sizzle in this story."" Based on
Focal's expanded business plan, SSB and Grubman predicted that the company's revenue within
11
10 years would increase to $6 billion and EBITDA would increase to $2.4 billion. The Note
described Focal management as ""stellar."" The Note did not disclose the additional capital
12
expenditures that would be necessary to fund Focal's expanded business plan or the risk the
company may not be able to obtain such capital. It did not disclose the likelihood that the
13
expanded business plan would increase the company's substantial negative operating cash flow
and substantial net operating losses.
14
83. On April 18, 2000, SSB and Grubman issued a Note reiterating the $110 price target and Buy
rating. The April 18 Note stated that ""[Focal] is expanding its business plan to 24 markets and
15
aggressively pursuing data opportunities
The name of the game in value creation is to drive
geographic footprint & service capabilities. Focal is dramatically increasing the latter w/its data
16
initiative while increasing its geographic footprint by 15-20% We reiterate our Buy rating & $110
target & would be aggressive buyers."" The April 18, 2000 Note did not disclose the additional
17
capital expenditures that would be necessary to fund Focal's expanded business plan or the risk
the company may not be able to obtain such capital. It did not disclose the likelihood that the
18
expanded business plan would increase the substantial negative operating cash flow and
substantial net operating losses the company faced in the foreseeable future.
19
84. On April 26, 2000, SSB and Grubman issued a Note that reiterated a Buy recommendation, the
20
$110 target price, and Grubman's predictions of substantial growth in the company's revenues and
EBITDA, By this time, Focal's share price had dropped to $34.00. The Note repeated Grubman's
earlier comments that Focal's new data initiative ""is the real sizzle in this story
we believe that
21
[Focal's] recent geographic & data expansion will enable [Focal] to become one of the critical path
22
points in what is the next evolution in the Internet."" The Note stated:
From a liquidity standpoint, no matier what happens with the capital
23
markets, between the money [Focal] has on hand and its bank
facilities commitments, we believe that [Focal] will be fully funded
24
through mid- to late-2001. During the first quarter, [Focal] completed
a $275 million offering of 11 7/8% senior notes due 2010 through a
25
private placement.

85.
The
Note
concluded
with
another
recommendation
for
investors
to

the
stock:

it

3
the likelihood that the expanded business plan would increase the substantial negative operatir
cash flow and substantial net operating losses the company faced in the foreseeable future.
4
86. The Note SSB and Grubman published on July 31, 2000 left the rating and target price
5
unchanged. The Note extolled the virtues of Focal's management, stating that the reported stri
earnings for second quarter 2000 ""highlights the execution abilities of FCOM management
repeated earlier advice to investors that ""the stock is undervalued at current levels."" The July 3
6
Note stated:
7
From a liquidity standpoint, [Focal] received a commitment for $300
million of senior secured credit facilities during the quarter. Capital
8
expenditures totaled $77 million this quarter and we still expect
[Focal] to spend $300 million and $305 million in 2001. We estimate
9
that with the cash on hand of $342 million and the available credit,
[Focal] will be fully funded through 2001.
10
87. Missing from the July 31 Note, however, were sufficient risk disclosures adequate to warn
11
investors of the funding needs facing Focal. The Note did not disclose the additional capital
expenditures that would be necessary to fund Focal's expanded business plan or the risk that 1
12
company may not be able to obtain such capital. It did not disclose the likelihood that the
expanded business plan would increase the substantial negative operating cash flow and
13
substantial net operating losses the company faced in the foreseeable future.
88. By October 17, 2000, Focal's stock price had plummoted to $18. That day, SSB and Grub
14
issued a Report on Focal and other CLECs entitled ""CLECs: Clean Up of Ratings, Price Targe
DCFs."" In this Report, SSB and Grubman maintained a Buy (1) rating on Focal, but lowered
15
Focal's target price from $110 to $30, noting that the previous target price was ""a clearly stale
number."" Despite advising investors for months prior to October that Focal's new business
16
strategy was ""sexy"" and ""the sizzle to the story"" and would raise Focal's stock price by $50,
Grubman decreased Focal's price target in part by substantially reducing the revenue expecte
17
from the new business strategy.
18
2.
Level 3, Focal, RCN, Adelphia, WCG and XO
89. As described above in Section D, in April 2001 Grubman expressed the need to downgrad
19
Level 3, Focal, RCN, Adelphia, WCG, and XO in the aftermath of the Winstar bankruptcy.
Investment bankers pressured Grubman not to change the Buy ratings on these stocks and h
20
not downgrade them until months later.
21
90. None of the following Notes for these companies issued between April 18, 2001 and the d
the stocks were downgraded disclosed the pressure the investment bankers had exerted on
22
Grubman or the fact that he had acceded to it; these Notes were inconsistent with the views
Grubman had expressed, as reflected in the e-mails described in Section D. above, concernir
23
these stocks:
24
25
3
For the additional reasons set forth in Section E, the Note on Focal for April 30, 2001 was
fraudulent.

Level 3: Report issued on April 18, 2001.

RCN:
Report issued on May 3, 2001.
3.
WCG
4
91. The May 1, 2001 Note on WCG lacked a reasonable basis because it did not disclose the
5
contrary private views of Grubman and a member of his team. On May 1, 2001, SSB and
Grubman issued a Note that failed adequately to disclose the views of Grubman and another
6
analyst of the funding risks facing WCG. Before the issuance of that Note, Grubman and the
analyst commented privately that the company ""need money."" These funding concerns were so
7
acute that the analyst warned an institutional investor to ""be careful with WCG.' Similarly,
Grubman explained to a SSB retail broker who complained about Grubman's target price for WCG
8
that WCG was a ""tough one. They still need money. I think business is ok
9
92. The May 1 Note, however, reiterated a Buy recommendation on the stock. It noted that
""visibility on funding better vs. 6 mos. ago."" It reassured investors that WCG had adequate funds
10
""into 2003."" The Note stated that the company had reduced capital expenditures and ""has made
steps to improve its funding situation since the beginning of the year and have [sic] raised
11
additional liquidity of more than $2 billion."" While predicting that the company may need $1 billion
to fund its operations in 2003, the Note stated ""frankly, if the second tranche of the bank facility
12
gets fully syndicated out, and WCG does perform as it expects
then our funding gap will be cut
dramatically.'
13
93. The May 1 Note failed to accurately describe the negative view of Grubman and the analyst
who reported to him of the company's funding concerns. Rather than informing investors that
14
WCG's business was merely ""ok"" or a ""tough one,' the May 2001 Note advised investors to ""be
more aggressive on [WCG]."" The Note did not warn investors to ""be careful"" with WCG and did not
15
fully reflect the analysts' views on the company's funding needs.

G.
Undisclosed Conflicts of Interest Pervaded Grubman's Upgrade of AT&T in
November 1999
17
1.
AT&T Complained About Grubman's Views of the Company
18
94. From 1995 through November 1999, Grubman maintained a Neutral (3) rating on AT&T.
19
Though at times he offered qualified approval of AT&T's strategy, he also repeatedly disparaged
the company in his research and his public comments.
20
95. Beginning in July 1998 and continuing through the relevant period, Sanford Weill, then co-CEO
21
and Chairman of Citigroup, was a member of the AT&T Board of Directors. Prior to November
1999, AT&T management complained to Weill and other SSB representatives about the tone of
22
Grubman's comments. In particular, the AT&T CEO told Weill that Grubman's unprofessional tone
and comments about AT&T made it difficult for AT&T to do business with SSB.
23
96. At an October 1998 industry trade show, Grubman failed to mention AT&T as one of the
important lelecommunications companies of the future. AT&T complained to Weill, and Weill
24
relayed the complaint to senior SSB investment bankers. As a result, Grubman wrote a letter of
apology dated October 9, 1998 to Weill and the heads of SSB's investment banking and equities
25
departments. Before it was finalized, the letter was reviewed and approved by Weill and several
members of senior management. Grubman's apology stated, in part:
1
It has come to my attention that a speech | made offended AT&T.
I
want to make it perfectly clear that the last thing I want to do is
2
embarrass the firm or myself or for that matter have AT&T put in an
awkward position in dealing with Salomon Smith Barney. To the
3
extent I have done so, / apologize to you and to the firm. I will also
find the appropriate time and place to apologize directly to AT&T.
4
Despite our current investment stance on AT&T, I view AT&T as one
of the most significant companies in this industry, a company that I
hope we can build a long and valued relationship with and one where
5
I truly am open-minded about changes in investment views.
6
97. in his cover memo to the head of SSB investment banking, and the SSB investment banker
covering AT&T, Grubman indicated that his letter was suitable to send to AT&T. On October 12,
7
Weill and the investment banker covering AT&T traveled to AT&T's Basking Ridge, NJ
headquarters and met with AT&T's CEO.
8
2.
Weill Asked Grubman to ""Take a Fresh Look"" at AT&T
9
98. A few months later, in late 1998 or early 1999, Weill asked Grubman to ""take a fresh look"" at
10
AT&T in the hope that Grubman might change his opinion of the company. Weill had a positive
view of AT&T and its CEO, whom Weill had known personally for years. AT&T's CEO was a
11
member of Citigroup's Board of Directors during the relevant period and, prior to the merger of
Citicorp and Travelers Corporation (SSB's corporate parent), had been a member of the Travelers'
12
Board of Directors since 1993.
13
99. Thereafter, on April 5, 1999, Grubman sent AT&T a seven-page questionnaire seeking further
information about its business. On June 11, 1999 Grubman sent Weill a memorandum noting that
AT&T had not responded to his questionnaire. Weill apparently then spoke to AT&T's CEO about
14
the questionnaire. AT&T asked Grubman to re-send the questionnaire, and Grubman wrote Weill:
""Maybe this time we can actually make some progress in closing the deal with [AT&T's CEO]."" On
15
July 19, 1999, AT&T sent an eleven-page response to Grubman.
16
100. On August 5, 1999 Grubman and Weill traveled to AT&T's headquarters for a meeting with
AT&T's CEO that Weill had arranged. On August 19, 1999, Grubman wrote to AT&T's CEO:
17
I am writing to follow up on our meeting with Sandy
I thought it
18
was important to write to you directly to lay-out what I think we
agreed to in order to get this process going
I
need to get to a
19
level of specificity well beyond what's on the street today and I will
need your help getting to the right people
Wall Street is lacking
20
analysis that comes remotely close to answering the detailed
economic, technical, and operational questions that investors are
21
demanding answers to regarding the roll-out of the bundled service
platform using the cable plant
When my analysis is complete
and if the results are in line with what you and I are both anticipating,
22
once I'm on board there will be no better supporter than I.
As I
indicated to you at our meeting, i would welcome the role of being a
23
""kitchen cabinet"" member to you.
101. Grubman sent a copy of his August 19, 1999 letter to Weill, SSB's head of investment
24
banking, and the SSB investment banker covering AT&T.

3.
Grubman Requested Weill's Assistance to Get His Children Accepted to the
92nd St. Y Preschool and AT&T Considered Issuing a Tracking Stock for Its
2
Wireless Unit
3
102. In September 1999, Grubman began his efforts to get his children admitted to the prestigiou
and competitive preschool at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.
4
103. On October 20, 1999, the AT&T Board of Directors began discussing whether to issue a
tracking stock for its wireless unit. That day, Weill attended an all-day meeting of the AT&T Board
5
at which AT&T's management presented a number of strategic alternatives, including issuing a
tracking stock for AT&T's wireless business.
6
104. On October 29, 1999, Weill and Grubman had a 14 minute telephone conversation during
7
which they discussed the status of Grubman's ""fresh look"" at AT&T. In that conversation or one
shortly thereafter, they also discussed Grubman's desire to send his children to the 92nd Street Y
8
preschool in New York City.
9
105. By November 2, AT&T had taken its first steps towards issuing a tracker stock for its wireles
unit. That day, an investment banking firm advising AT&T on financial strategies met with AT&T's
10
outside counsel to discuss a proxy statement for AT&T shareholder approval of the wireless
tracker.
11
106. On November 5, 1999, Grubman sent a memo to Weill entitled ""AT&T and 92nd Street Y."" I
12
it, Grubman updated Weill on his progress in ""taking a fresh look"" at AT&T and outlined the futur
steps he would take to reexamine the company. He referred to his earlier meeting with AT&T's
13
CEO and to his scheduled meetings in Denver with the head of AT&T's cable operations and in
Basking Ridge with AT&T's network operations personnel. Grubman also sought Weill's
assistance in getting his children admitted to the 92nd Street Y preschool. Noting the difficulty in
14
getting into the school, Grubman stated that ""there are no bounds for what you do for your childr.
it comes down to 'who you know."" In the last paragraph of his memo, Grubman concluded:
15
Anyway, anything you could do Sandy would be greatly appreciated. As I mentioned, 1 will kee|
you posted on the progress with AT&T which ) think is going well.
16
4.
Grubman Kept Weill Apprised of His Reevaluation of AT&T in November 19!
17
AT&T Management Recommended That AT&T Issue a Tracking Stock
18 107. During November 1999, Grubman intensified his ""fresh look"" at AT&T. He met and spoke
telephone with AT&T's CEO and traveled to AT&T's Denver and New Jersey offices to meet wit
19
company officials and view AT&T's operations. Grubman reported on his efforts to Weill during
unprecedented number of telephone calls on November 3, 11, 17, 22, 24 and 30.
20
108. On the morning of November 17, Weill attended an AT&T board meeting at which senior
21
AT&T management recommended that the board approve the issuance of a tracking stock for
wireless business. Grubman called Weill from Milan, Italy late that night and the two discussed
status of Grubman's ""fresh look"" at AT&T. During a call on November 22 or November 24,
22
Grubman informed Weill that he soon would be issuing a report upgrading AT&T.
23
5.
Grubman Upgraded AT&T and Subsequently Stated He Did So to Get His
Children Into the 92nd St. Y Preschool
24
109. Grubman announced on November 29, 1999 that he was upgrading AT&T from a Neutra
25
to a Buy (1) rating. The same day, Grubman sent an e-mail to the SSB publications departme
with a copy to Research Management, stating:
1
The AT&T Report must be edited and mailed out to the printers today
so that it can be distributed in time to meet Sandy Weill's deadline
2
(before the AT&T meeting.)
3
110. The next day, Grubman issued a 36-page Report setting forth his new rating and rationale.
In his November 30 Report, Grubman wrote that his upgrade rested largely on two points: (1) the
4
""real economics"" of AT&T's cable strategy and (2) AT&T's ability to upgrade its cable technology to
deliver a range of different services to consumers' homes. Grubman commented positively in his
report about the widely-reported wireless tracking stock but denied upgrading because of the
5
possible IPO.
6
111. After issuing the report, Grubman told an analyst who reported to him and an institutional
investor, in separate conversations, that he upgraded AT&T to help get his children into the 92nd St.
7
Y preschool.
8
112. Roughly a year after the upgrade, on January 13, 2001, in an e-mail to a friend, Grubman
stated:
9
You know everyone thinks I upgraded T [AT&T] to get lead for AWE
10
[AT&T Wireless tracker]. Nope. I used Sandy to get my kids into
92nd St Y pre-school (which is harder than Harvard) and Sandy
11
needed [the AT&T's CEO's] vote on our board to nuke [John] Reed in
showdown. Once coast was clear for both of us (ie Sandy clear
12
victor and my kids confirmed) I went back to my normal negative self
on T. [AT&T's CEO] never knew that we both (Sandy and I) played
him like a fiddle.
13
113. The following day, Grubman e-mailed the same friend: ""I always viewed T [AT&T] as
a
14
business deal between me and Sandy.""
15
6.
After the AT&T Upgrade, Weill Helped Facilitate the Admission of Grubman's
Children to the 92nd St. Y Preschool
16
114. After Grubman issued his November 1999 report on AT&T, Weill helped gain admission for
17
Grubman's children to the 92nd St. Y preschool. On or about December 17, 1999, Weill called a
member of the 92nd St. Y board and told her he would be ""very appreciative"" if she would help
18
Grubman, a ""valued employee"" at Citigroup. Weill did not explicitly offer a donation to the Y during
this phone call. By indicating that he would be ""very appreciative,"" he understood that he was
19
implicitly offering such assistance.
20
115. In March 2000, Grubman's children were admitted to the Y preschool. Subsequently, the
board member called Weill, suggested a donation be made to the Y, and may have suggested the
21
amount. Weill agreed. Weill was one of three corporate officers who approved charitable
donations from Citigroup or the Citigroup Foundation. During a subsequent conversation with the
president of the Citigroup Foundation, Weill indicated that the Foundation should make a $1 million
22
donation to the Y and instructed the Foundation president to work with the Y to develop a suitable
program with the donation. The program that was subsequently developed consisted of a series of
23
10 events per year that had cultural, artistic, and educational aims. Weill, the president of the
foundation, and another Citigroup corporate officer approved the donation on July 24, 20004 and
24
25
4
Because of certain tax considerations, and in light of benefits Citigroup employees received from
the program supported by the donation, Citigroup, not Citigroup Foundation, made the donation to the Y.
The $1 million donation was payable in equal amounts over five years.
1
the first installment of the donation ($200,000) was sent to the Y in September 2000. The
president of the Foundation understood the donation was a ""thank you"" for the admission of the
2
Grubman children to the preschool at the 92nd St. Y.

7.
After Grubman's Upgrade of AT&T, AT&T Selected SSB as a Lead Underwriter
in the AT&T Wireless IPO
4
116. Grubman's upgrade of AT&T assisted SSB in being selected as a lead underwriter and joint
5
book-runner for the IPO of a tracking stock for AT&T's wireless subsidiary.
117. The AT&T Board approved the IPO during its December 5, 1999 Board meeting. AT&T
6
announced its plans at a meeting with analysts the following day.
7
118. In January 2000, SSB competed to be named a lead underwriter and book-runner for the
offering. In its pitch book, it highlighted the experience, prominence, and support for AT&T of
8
Grubman and the SSB wireless analyst. Among other things, SSB's pitch book contained
numerous statements about Grubman's views regarding the positive impact the wireless tracking
9
stock would have on AT&T's shares, as well as promises about the role he would play in marketing
the deal to investors.
10
119. In evaluating the various proposals from SSB and other investment banks, AT&T assigned
11
significant weight (55%) to its views of each investment bank's wireline and wireless
telecommunications analysts. Because Grubman was a highly rated and highly respected analyst,
12
had a ""strong buy"" on AT&T stock, and was a ""strong supporter"" of the company, AT&T gave him
the highest possible score in the internal matrix it used to rank the competing investment banks. In
13
February 2000, based in large part on this positive evaluation of Grubman, AT&T named SSB as
one of three joint book-runners for the AT&T Wireless IPO. The IPO occurred on April 27, 2000. It
was the largest equity offering ever in the United States, and SSB earned $63 million in fees as
14
lead underwriter for the offering.
15
8.
Grubman Downgraded AT&T
16
120. On May 17, 2000, three weeks after the IPO, two months after his children were admitted to
the 92nd St. Y preschool, and after AT&T announced disappointing earnings, Grubman issued a
17
research report in which he compared AT&T with WorldCom. While Grubman did not change his
Buy ratings on the two companies, he lowered his target price for AT&T from $75 to $65 per share
18
and made a number of negative comments about AT&T.
19
121. Institutional investors viewed Grubman's report as a ""virtual downgrade"" because of his
unfavorable comparisons of AT&T to WorldCom. An internal AT&T document also reported that
20
Grubman was privately making comments to investors that were considerably more critical than
those in his written reports.
21
122. Grubman subsequently downgraded AT&T twice in October 2000: on October 6 he
downgraded the stock to an Outperform (2) and on October 25 he downgraded it to a Neutral (3),
22
citing what he described as negative news from the company.
23
9.
SSB's Policies Were Not Reasonably Designed To Prevent The Potential
Misuse Of Material, Non-Public Information
24
123. During the relevant period, SSB had general policies in place requiring its employees to
25
obtain approval before becoming a director of another company and to keep non-public information
about that company confidential. SSB did not, however, have adequate policies and procedures in
1
the first installment of the donation ($200,000) was sent to the Y in September 2000. The
president of the Foundation understood the donation was a ""thank you"" for the admission of the
2
Grubman children to the preschool at the 92nd St. Y.

123. During the relevant period, SSB had general policies in place requiring its employees to

obtain approval before becoming a director of another company and to keep non-public information
about that company confidential. SSB did not, however, have adequate policies and procedures in
1
place to ensure that communications between a person associated with SSB who served as a
director of another company and the SSB research analyst who covered that company would not
2
result in the misuse of material, non-public information by the research analyst. For example, one
such step SSB could have taken would have been to require that a company be placed on its
3
watch list if a person associated with SSB served as a director of that company. Such a procedure
would have helped SSB to monitor whether a research analyst, before publishing research on a
4
company, had received material non-public information on it from a person associated with SSB
who also served as one of the company's outside directors.

SSB Failed to Supervise Adequately the Activities of Its Research Analysts
6
1.
SSB Failed to Respond Adequately to Red Flags Regarding Research
7
124. Members of research management received copies of research reports and call notes when
they were issued and routinely reviewed research. Based on this review, complaints from SSB
8
employees and customers, and otherwise, SSB was aware of problems with its research. Indeed,
as described in Section B above, members of research management themselves expressed
9
reservations about SSB's research. Nevertheless, SSB did not take steps to supervise the
activities of research analysts adequately.
10
125. By early 2001, one of Grubman's supervisors believed that Grubman's ratings were
11
inconsistent with the performance and prospects of the some of the companies he covered.
12
126. Moreover, on July 2, 2001, a Director who provided Research Management Support sent an
e-mail to all research personnel, and others, warning that the models SSB analysts, including
13
Grubman, used to predict future revenues and earnings and generate target prices ""must make
sense"" (emphasis in original) and must be ""smell tested."" He criticized these models for using
""aggressive inputs to arrive at a predetermined valuation/outcome."" He concluded by noting that,
14
""Clearly, projected long-term growth rates for many of our companies are too high and
would benefit from a thoughtful reappraisal.' (Emphasis in original.) At least one recipient of
15
this e-mail thought he was referring to Grubman (""Amen! You should have cc'd this to Grubman
just to make sure."") The author of the e-mail did not disabuse the recipient of this assumption: ""No
16
comment on that, at least not in writing.""
17
127. The same person specifically criticized Grubman's research in a later e-mail to a senior
member of research management, implying that the research had been compromised by
18
investment banking concerns and acknowledging that SSB's lax supervision of Grubman was at
least partly to blame. He focused in particular on Grubman's coverage of Metromedia Fiber and
19
the June 6, 2001 Note (discussed above). He stated:
20
Explaining this isn't easy. My candid opinion is that, until quite
recently, Jack Grubman's team had not yet come to terms with the
21
debacle in this sector. While share prices plummeted, they remained
convinced of the longer-term potential of their group and were
22
unwilling to cut ratings and adopt a more cautious stance. When you
add the heavy layer of banking involvement into the mix this very
problematic situation gets easier to understand. (Emphasis added.)
23
128. He criticized Grubman's coverage of Metromedia Fiber in particular. He noted that

25
[e]xcessive optimism led to unattainable target prices that should

research legal as well, we clearly rely on senior analysts to do careful
7
work, disclose all important data and denote all material risks. In the
case of MFNX, and in other telecom situations that I could name, our
8
approach was inadequate. There was a failure of analysis and, it
pains me to confess, a failure of management. This is the only
9
explanation I can offer. (Emphasis added.)
10
2. SSB Knew SSB Investment Bankers Pressured Research Analysts
11
130. SSB knew that its business practices, which intertwined research and investment banking,
created a conflict of interest between investment banking and research, that investment banking
12
pressured research analysts, and that investment banking concerns had the potential to affect,
and, as described above with respect to Grubman, did affect, the decisions of research analysts on
ratings and coverage. Nevertheless, SSB failed to take adequate steps to prevent such pressure
13
or ensure that SSB's research was independent and objective.
14
131. SSB was aware that investment bankers pressured Grubman to maintain positive ratings or
change negative ratings on companies. Moreover, on November 17, 2000, shortly after SSB was
15
named in a private securities action relating to the AT&T Wireless IPO, Grubman e-mailed the
head of Global Equity Research:
16
I think all legal stuff on ATT should be forwarded to Sandy [Weill] and
17
[the head of SSB Investment Banking] as Exhibit A on why research
needs to be left alone. These guys never understand the lingering
18
consequences.

SSB Engaged in Improper Spinning and IPO Distribution Practices
20
132. SSB engaged in improper spinning practices whereby it provided preferential access to
valuable IPO shares to the executives of corporations from which SSB sought or had obtained
21
investment banking business. During the years 1999 and 2000, SSB earned over $6.6 billion in
investment banking revenue. Obtaining this investment banking business was critical to SSB's
success. For example, investment banking fees comprised over 21% of SSB's revenue in 1999,
22
and over 22% in 2000.
23
133. SSB failed to appropriately administer numerous Issuer Directed Share Programs (""DSPs"") it
managed during this same period. Further, SSB engaged in significant ""as of"" trading in IPOs and

failed to ensure that its distribution of IPO shares, both through DSPs and its branch offices, was
timely and accurately reflected in its books and records.

SSB Established a Special Branch to Facilitate Its Spinning Practices
2
134. SSB employed two registered representatives (""RRs"") whose primary function was to
open and service accounts for high net worth individuals who were founders, officers or
3
directors of current and potential banking clients (""Executive Accounts""). The two RRs had
begun servicing these types of accounts at Salomon Brothers and continued to perform
4
this function after Salomon merged with Travelers in 1997 to create SSB. SSB took steps
and entered into written agreements to provide these two RRs with preferential, special,
5
and unusual treatment including the following:
6
SSB gave each of these two RRs special compensation, including a draw of $1 million
for the first 6 months of their employment and a minimum of $500,000 for the second
7
6 months;
8
SSB provided office space for one of the two RRs on SSB's equities trading floor in
New York;
9
SSB treated the business of the two RRs, designated ""Private Wealth Management,""
10
as if it were a separate SSB branch office (""PWM Branch"") for the purpose of
determining IPO allocations, when it was actually only 2 brokers;5
11
SSB provided the two RRs with unique access to hot IPO shares to distribute to the
12
Executive Accounts that was far above and beyond that of any other broker or branch;
and
13
SSB provided the two RRs with access to IPO shares for distribution to the Executive
accounts from (i) the SSB Branch retail allocation, with PWM being treated as a
14
""branch office""; and (ii) the institutional pot, In some cases, the two RRs were able to
obtain access to DSP shares from issuers for distribution to the Executive Accounts.
15
2. SSB Provided Preferential Treatment to Executive Accounts in the Allocation of
16
Hot IPOs
17
135. SSB distributed its IPO shares by dividing the firm's allocation between its retail and
institutional clients. Generally, SSB allocated to its retail clients, as a group, approximately 20-30%
18
of the firm's allotment in any specific IPO, with a majority of the remaining shares designated for
allocations to institutional clients. Those shares set aside for retail clients were designated as the
19
""retail retention,"" and the remaining shares were designated as the ""institutional pot.'
20
136. The retail shares were distributed to specific accounts through SSB's branch managers. For
every IPO, SSB gave each branch manager a specific number of shares, and the manager
21
determined which retail brokers received shares and how many shares each retail broker received.
The retail broker then determined the allocation of shares among his or her retail accounts, subject
22
to the branch manager's final approval.
23
137. The PWM Branch and its clients, however, were treated differently. As noted, the two RRs'
client base consisted primarily of high net worth individuals whose companies were potential
24
investment banking clients or had provided investment banking business to SSB, and these two

5 The two RRs ended their partnership in 1999 after which each operated as a separate branch and the
practices described herein continued. However, the two RRs are referred to as the ""PWM Branch.""

practices described herein continued. However, the two RRs are referred to as the ""PWM Branch.""
1
individual brokers were designated as a special branch with a separate profit and loss assessment.
The PWM Branch received favorable treatment in the allocation of hot IPO shares. Although
2
SSB's written procedures for the distribution of IPO shares specifically prohibited favoritism for the
personal accounts of corporate executives, SSB in fact provided preferential treatment to
3
Executive Accounts in connection with the distribution of hot IPO shares throughout the relevant
period.
4
a.
Special Access to Retail and Institutional Shares
5
138. While other SSB retail branches were ordinarily limited to receiving IPO shares for clients
from the retail retention, in many instances the two RRs in the PWM Branch obtained shares from
6
both the retail retention and the institutional pot. This arrangement enabled them to consistently
provide the Executive Accounts with larger numbers of shares in lucrative hot IPOs than were
7
allocated to other retail accounts.
8
139. For example, from June 1996 through August 2000, WorldCom's then-President and CEO
received IPO allocations in 9 offerings from Salomon and 12 offerings from SSB. He made profits
9
of $10,612,680 and $923,360 respectively, totaling $11,536,041 on these IPO allocations. From
1996 through 2000, WorldCom paid $75,955,000 in investment banking fees to SSB.
10
140. During 1999 and 2000, the two RRs in the PWM Branch received 35% of the total IPO shares
11
allocated for distribution to SSB's ten largest branches and PWM combined. During this same
period, these two brokers generated less than 3% of this combined group's commission revenue
12
and had less than 5% of the group's assets under management. In 5.3% of the IPOs during this
period, the two PWM brokers alone received a greater IPO allocation than the total shares
13
distributed to SSB's ten largest branches.
b.
PWM's Solicitation of Syndicate for Additional IPO Shares
14
141. In addition to the arrangement that provided the two PWM brokers with special access to
15
large numbers of IPO shares for its client base, these two RRs aggressively solicited the Syndicate
Department for additional shares in order to give preferential treatment to founders, officers, and
16
directors of investment banking clients. PWM brokers regularly requested additional shares from
Syndicate, while retail brokers did so rarely. This occurred as early as 1996 and continued
17
throughout the relevant period. For example, in a June 7, 1996 facsimile to the Syndicate
Department, one of the RRs requested shares in the McLeod USA IPO for ""Salomon Brothers
18
Investment Banking Relationships to receive preferential treatment.""
19
c.
Special Access to DSP Shares
20
142. As well as obtaining hot IPO shares for Executive Accounts from the retail retention and
institutional pot, a PWM broker sought access, on at least one occasion, to shares reserved for an
Issuer's Directed Share Program for allocation to Executive Accounts.6
21
143. In a July 6, 1999 letter, one of the two PWM Branch RRs solicited the President and CEO of
22
Focal for the inclusion of various favored Executive Accounts in Focal's DSP. Of the seventeen
listed PWM clients who were Focal bondholders requesting equity shares, at least thirteen were
23
24
6
In each IPO, shares were set aside for distribution to a group of individuals designated by the Issuer
25
through its Directed Share Program, sometimes referred to as the ""friends and family"" program.

1
telecom company executives. One of these seventeen PWM clients, the former CEO of McLeod
USA, received 100,000 shares through Focal's DSP.
2
144. SSB also directly allocated issuers' DSP shares to the Executive Accounts. When trades
3
through an Issuer's DSP program could not be confirmed, SSB used those shares for its own
clients and distributed them to its favored accounts. For example, one of the PWM RRs was
4
assigned by SSB to administer the KQIP DSP. KQIP began trading in the aftermarket on
November 9, 1999. Several days later, the issuer's CFO contacted the PWM RR and stated that
20,000 shares of IPO stock were left over from the DSP, and asked if the RR would like to allocate
5
the shares to one of his clients. The RR took the DSP shares and in turn gave them to another
broker who had assisted him with the KQIP DSP for allocation to that broker's favored customers.
6
On November 12, 1999, the second broker allocated 5,000 shares of KQIP IPO stock to a
customer, who was able to purchase them at the IPO price. On November 16, 1999, the broker
7
allocated the remaining 15,000 shares of KQIP IPO stock to the same customer at the IPO price.
On December 24, 1999 the customer sold all 20,000 shares of KQIP for a profit of $832,540.
8
145. Additionally, several Executive Accounts serviced by the PWM brokers received IPO shares
9
from a significant númber of DSPs. For example, DSP shares were allocated in more than one-
third of the SSB IPOs awarded to the former Executive Vice President of Qwest Communications
10
International from May 1998 through September 2000. Likewise, DSP shares were allocated in
half of the SSB IPOs awarded to the President of Qwest Communications International from June
11
1999 through September 2000.

Both SSB and Executives of the Firm's Investment Banking Clients Profited
Significantly From SSB's Spinning Practices
13
146. The spinning practices engaged in by Salomon before the merger with Citigroup, and then by
SSB after the merger through the PWM Branch proved very lucrative to both the firm and the
14
executives of the firm's investment banking clients. Executives of five telecom companies made
approximately $40 million in profits from approximately 3.4 million IPO shares allocated from 1996
15
- 2001, and SSB earned over $404 million in investment banking fees from those companies
during the same period.

SSB Could Not Rely on Its Records to Determine if IPOs Were Fully
Distributed
8
147. SSB's record keeping and its system of assessing whether the IPO distribution was
9
completed were totally inadequate. The records failed to timely and accurately record the firm's
distribution of IPO shares to its clients. As a result, the firm could not rely on these records to
10
ensure that the distribution was complete. This faulty record keeping was particularly evident in the
areas of ""as of"" trades and the distribution of DSP shares. These ""as of"" trades frequently provided
11
immediate profits to the recipients.
12
a.
""As Of"" Trades
13
148. In the Metromedia Fiber offering, SSB booked approximately 68% of all allocations on an ""as
of"" basis two days or more after the IPO date and well after secondary market trading had begun in
14
each stock. In the Juniper Networks offering, over 80% of all allocations booked by SSB were
booked on an ""as of"" basis two days or more after the IPO date. In at least 10 offerings, over 10%
15
of the offering was booked on an ""as of"" basis two or more days after the IPO date.
16
149. SSB placed a number of these ""as of"" IPO trades in Executive Accounts. In addition, SSB's
inadequate record keeping led to the appearance that certain IPO allocations were sold short in
17
violation of industry regulations. For example, Juniper Networks (""JNPR"") IPO stock went public
on Thursday, June 24, 1999 at $34 per share. Trade tickets for the purchase of 5000 shares by
18
WorldCom's former President and CEO were marked on the day after the IPO, Friday, June 25 at
3:12 p.m., and the shares were not booked into the account until the following Tuesday, June 29.
19
SSB recorded this transaction on an ""as of"" basis. Though the shares had not yet been booked into
the client's account and the tickets for the IPO trades were not yet written and time stamped, the
20
CEO sold 4,000 JNPR shares on June 25 at 12:03 p.m., at prices of $100 and $100.31 per share,
for a profit of $264,125. The CEO sold the remaining 1,000 shares of JNPR on April 4, 2000 at
$210 per share, following a 3:1 stock split, for a total profit of $860, 125.
21
150. Similarly, the former Chairman of Qwest Communications also received several ""as of"" IPO
22
allocations that traded at a substantial profit in the aftermarket. For example, SSB booked 5000
JNPR IPO shares into the account of the Qwest Chairman on June 29, 1999, even though the IPO
23
trade tickets were time stamped at 3:12 p.m. on June 25, one day after the IPO date. At 11:59
a.m. on June 25, the Qwest Chairman sold 2000 shares of JNPR for a profit of $132,063, even
24
though the tickets for the IPO trades had not yet been written and time stamped, once again giving
the appearance that the IPO shares were sold short, In addition, on June 5, 2000, SSB booked
25
10,000 shares of ONI Systems Corp. (""ONIS"") IPO stock into this same client's account at the IPO
price, even though ONIS had begun trading in the aftermarket on June 1, 2000. The Qwest
Chairman ultimately sold the ONIS IPO stock for a profit of more than $562,000.

$210 per share, following a 3:1 stock split, for a total profit of $860, 125.
150. Similarly, the former Chairman of Qwest Communications also received several ""as of"" IPO
22
allocations that traded at a substantial profit in the aftermarket. For example, SSB booked 5000
JNPR IPO shares into the account of the Qwest Chairman on June 29, 1999, even though the IPO
23
trade tickets were time stamped at 3:12 p.m. on June 25, one day after the IPO date. At 11:59
a.m. on June 25, the Qwest Chairman sold 2000 shares of JNPR for a profit of $132,063, even
24
though the tickets for the IPO trades had not yet been written and time stamped, once again giving
the appearance that the IPO shares were sold short. In addition, on June 5, 2000, SSB booked
25
10,000 shares of ONI Systems Corp. (""ONIS"") IPO stock into this same client's account at the IPO
price, even though ONIS had begun trading in the aftermarket on June 1, 2000. The Qwest
Chairman ultimately sold the ONIS IPO stock for a profit of more than $562,000.

b.
Directed Share Programs
2
151. In many instances in which SSB was retained to administer the issuer's DSP, a large number
of allocations were booked into customers' accounts after the stock began trading in the secondary
3
market, resulting in a substantial number of ""as of"" trades. Some of these instances resulted
directly from SSB's failure to ensure that orders for DSP shares were confirmed prior to the start of
4
secondary market trading. In fact, one of the PWM brokers acknowledged that, if he could not
confirm a DSP allocation with a program participant, he would continue to attempt to contact
participants even after secondary market trading had begun in the stock. SSB's inadequate record
5
keeping left the firm unable to ensure that the distribution of DSP shares had been completed
before the stock began trading in the secondary market.
6
152. Moreover, SSB did not appropriately administer DSPs. For example, SSB relied upon branch
7
offices and their staff to manage these labor-intensive programs without adequate central
supervision and coordination. Further, despite managing numerous DSPs, SSB had no written
8
procedures or supervisory system in effect to ensure the appropriate administration of these
programs and the complete and timely distribution of DSP shares.

5.
SSB Failed to Supervise Reasonably the Activities of the PWM Branch and
Others to Prevent Spinning
11
153. SSB failed to have supervisory procedures and systems in place to (i) prevent spinning; (ii)
12
create records it could reasonably rely upon to assess whether or not the distribution of IPO shares
was completed in `compliance with applicable law; and (iii) ensure that issuers' DSP programs were
managed in conformance with all applicable industry rules and regulations.
13
154. By establishing the PWM Branch and providing the two RRs with several special
14
considerations, including the ability to obtain significantly larger hot IPO allocations than other
brokers, SSB ensured favorable treatment for the Éxecutive Accounts. Moreover, SSB
15
management failed to adequately supervise the allocation process and specifically failed to take
steps to ensure that the PWM Branch complied with SSB's policy prohibiting favoritism for the
16
personal accounts of corporate executives. SSB also failed to accurately and timely record its
distribution of IPO shares and failed to have a system to ensure that IPO distributions were
17
completed, and recorded as completed, prior to the initiation of aftermarket trading. Finally, SSB
failed to adopt written supervisory procedures and a supervisory system sufficient to ensure that
18
the firm appropriately administered DSPs.

I. FINDINGS OF FACT
19
CSFB admits the jurisdiction of the Alaska division, neither admits nor denies the Findings
20
of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by
the division.
21
1. Summary
22
A. From July 1998 through December 2001 (the ""relevant period""), CSFB used its equity
research analysts to help solicit and conduct investment banking business. By providing
23
incentives for equity research analysts to assist in the generation of investment banking
revenues, CSFB created and fostered an environment with conflicts of interest that, in some
24
circumstances, undermined the independence of research analysts and affected the
objectivity of the reports they issued.
25
1
B. The conflicts of interest and pressure on equity research analysts to contribute to
investment banking revenue were particularly present in CSFB's Technology Group, headed
2
by Frank Quattrone, where research analysts' supervision and compensation were closely
aligned with investment banking. CSFB's investment banking revenue, driven mostly by
3
technology stocks, steadily and significantly increased, from $1.79 billion in 1998, to $2.32
billion in 1999, and to $3.68 billion in 2000. The sphere of influence and authority that
4
Quattrone exercised at CSFB remained significant throughout the technology boom.
5
C. CSFB's efforts to attract potential and continued investment banking business created
pressure on equity research analysts to initiate and maintain favorable coverage on
6
investment banking clients. This pressure at times undermined equity research analyst
objectivity and independence. CSFB's marketing, or ""pitch,"" materials in some instances
7
implicitly promised that a company would receive favorable research if it agreed to use
CSFB for its investment banking business. In addition, companies, in some instances
8
pressured analysts to continue coverage or maintain a certain rating or else risk losing the
company as an investment-banking client. In certain instances, these factors compromised
9
the independence of equity research analysts and impaired the objectivity of research
reports.
10
D. The independence of some of CSFB's equity research analysts was also impaired by
the fact that they were evaluated, in part, by investment banking professionals and that their
11
compensation was influenced by their contribution to investment banking revenues. Indeed,
the vast majority of their overall compensation, in the form of bonuses, was based on the
12
investment banking revenues generated by the firm. In many instances, bonuses for non-
technology equity research analysts' were directly linked to revenue generated by the firm
13
on specific investment banking transactions. The fact that an equity research analyst's
bonus was in part related to revenue from investment banking business created pressure on
14
analysts to help generate more investment banking revenue.
15
E. The undue and improper influence imposed by CSFB's investment bankers on the firm's
technology research analysts caused CSFB to issue fraudulent research reports on two
16
companies: Digital Impact, Inc. (""Digital Impact"") and Synopsys, Inc. (""Synopsys""). The
reports were fraudulent in that they expressed positive views of the companies' stocks that
17
were contrary to the analysts' true, privately held beliefs. In these instances, investment
bankers pressured research analysts to initiate or maintain positive research coverage to
18
obtain or retain investment banking business, and the analysts were pressured or compelled
to compromise their own professional opinions regarding the companies at the direction of
19
the firm's investment bankers. In addition, as to Numerical Technologies, Inc. (""Numerical
Technologies""), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent""), and Winstar Communications, Inc.
20
(""Winstar"") - the pressure on analysts resulted in the issuance of research reports that

disclose that CSFB and the research analysts covering NPW had proprietary interests in

23
F. CSFB also engaged in improper IPO ""spinning"" activities. From 1999 until April 2001,
CSFB, through its Technology Private Client Services Group, a department within the
24
Technology Group, allocated shares in CSFB's lead-managed technology IPOs to executive
officers of its investment banking clients who were in a position to provide investment
25
banking business to CSFB. This group engaged in such spinning with the belief and
expectation that the executives would steer investment banking business for their

B. The conflicts of interest and pressure on equity research analysts to contribute to
investment banking revenue were particularly present in CSFB's Technology Group, headed
2
by Frank Quattrone, where research analysts' supervision and compensation were closely
aligned with investment banking. CSFB's investment banking revenue, driven mostly by
3
technology stocks, steadily and significantly increased, from $1.79 billion in 1998, to $2.32
billion in 1999, and to $3.68 billion in 2000. The sphere of influence and authority that
4
Quattrone exercised at CSFB remained significant throughout the technology boom.
5
C. CSFB's efforts to attract potential and continued investment banking business created
pressure on equity research analysts to initiate and maintain favorable coverage on
6
investment banking clients. This pressure at times undermined equity research analyst
objectivity and independence. CSFB's marketing, or ""pitch,"" materials in some instances
7
implicitly promised that a company would receive favorable research if it agreed to use
CSFB for its investment banking business. In addition, companies, in some instances
8
pressured analysts to continue coverage or maintain a certain rating or else risk losing the
company as an investment-banking client. In certain instances, these factors compromised
the independence of equity research analysts and impaired the objectivity of research
9
reports.
10
D. The independence of some of CSFB's equity research analysts was also impaired by
the fact that they were evaluated, in part, by investment banking professionals and that their
11
compensation was influenced by their contribution to investment banking revenues. Indeed,
the vast majority of their overall compensation, in the form of bonuses, was based on the
12
investment banking revenues generated by the firm. In many instances, bonuses for non-
technology equity research analysts' were directly linked to revenue generated by the firm
13
on specific investment banking transactions. The fact that an equity research analyst's
bonus was in part related to revenue from investment banking business created pressure on
14
analysts to help generate more investment banking revenue,
15
E. The undue and improper influence imposed by CSFB's investment bankers on the firm's
technology research analysts caused CSFB to issue fraudulent research reports on two
16
companies: Digital Impact, Inc. (""Digital Impact"") and Synopsys, Inc. (""Synopsys""). The
reports were fraudulent in that they expressed positive views of the companies' stocks that
17
were contrary to the analysts' true, privately held beliefs. In these instances, investment
bankers pressured research analysts to initiate or maintain positive research coverage to
18
obtain or retain investment banking business, and the analysts were pressured or compelled
to compromise their own professional opinions regarding the companies at the direction of
19
the firm's investment bankers. In addition, as to Numerical Technologies, Inc. (""Numerical

13
b. The Supervisory Structure of CSFB's Technology Group Created Conflicts of
Interest for Equity Research Analysts and Lacked Sufficient Supervision of the
14
Technology PCS Group
A. Until June 1998, all of CSFB's equity research was issued through research analysts
15
who worked in the Equity Research Department and who reported to the Director of Equity
Research. Until that time, no equity research analysts were supervised by or had any
16
reporting obligations to anyone in any investment banking department.
17
B. In June 1998, CSFB recruited Frank Quattrone, who was then in a senior position at
Deutsche Bank Securities (also known as Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. or ""DMG"") to head
18
a distinct unit, the Technology Group, at CSFB that would provide an array of services to
technology companies. Quattrone became the Managing Director of the CSFB Technology
19
Group's Investment Banking Division, and negotiated a contract with CSFB to maintain the
Technology Group as a semi-autonomous, ""firm-within-a-firm"" unit within CSFB through
20
December 2001.
21
C. Quattrone established separate departments within the Technology Group for corporate
finance (investment banking), mergers and acquisitions, equity research, and a department
22
devoted to private client services (""PCS""), each of which reported to him. One of the
purposes of the PCS department was to provide personal brokerage services to officers of
23
investment banking clients of the Technology Group. The directors of the Technology
Group Research Department and PCS Department had dual reporting obligations to
24
Quattrone and to department directors in the firm's Equities Division, but as a practical
matter, the principal reporting line was to Quattrone until- a change in procedures instituted
in June 2001.
25
1
CSFB hired individuals who had worked closely with Quattrone at DMG to fill many
C. senior level positions, including each of the department directors, within the Technology had
2
worked together previously at DMG. In fact, many of the equity research analysts and
Group. Many of the people whom CSFB hired to work in the Technology Group
investment bankers whom CSFB employed from July 1998 through 2001 were recruited in July or
3
into CSFB from other firms. The first infusion of those professionals came
merged and August 1998, when the directors and others from DMG formed the Technology in Group at
4
CSFB. Given the wholesale move of the personnel, including senior management
research and investment banking, the reporting structure, work ethic, and future
5
expectations of their roles likewise carried over to their new positions at CSFB.
6
As a result of the structure set forth above, Quattrone exercised his authority to apply He an
D. overall Technology Group strategy in his supervision of the Group's research analysts.
7
used that authority for ""resource allocation"" to influence the determination of those sectors, would
and in some cases the particular companies on which Technology Group research
8
initiate or maintain coverage. As a consequence of Quattrone's influence, Technology
Group investment bankers were, at times, able to influence the sectors, and in some cases
9
the particular companies, for which CSFB technology research analysts initiated or
maintained coverage. At times, this determination was based on the level of CSFB's actual
10
or anticipated investment banking business with a particular company.
11
c. Investment Banking Revenue Was a Major Source of Revenue and Influence
at CSFB
12
A. primarily by the technology sector offerings completed under Quattrone's leadership.
From 1998 to 2000, CSFB's income from investment banking rose dramatically, fueled In
13
Group, CSFB's investment banking revenue increased from approximately $1.47 to
1998, driven in large part from the revenue generated by the newly formed Technology billion
14
approximately $1.79 billion or 21 percent. In 1999, the importance of investment banking as
a major source of revenue continued to grow, as did its revenue and number of employees. 22
15
That year, revenue from investment banking grew to approximately $2.318 billion, a
increase over 1998. Also in 1999, largely through the efforts of the Technology
16
percent Group, CSFB managed more domestic IPOs than any other investment banking firm. By
2000, CSFB's investment banking revenue had mushroomed to approximately $3.681
17
billion, a full 59 percent increase over the previous year. Investment banking revenue in
2000 represented the largest percent increase in revenue for CSFB, constituting its second
18
largest revenue source behind equity trading and sales and accounting for 30 percent of the
firm's total revenues.
19
d. CSFB's Equity Research Analysts' Bonuses Were Determined, in Part, by
20
the Degree to Which They Assisted Investment Banking, Thereby
Compromising Research Independence
21
Non-Technology Research
22
A. From July 1998 until May 2001, equity research analysts in non-technology sectors at
CSFB received bonuses that were directly and indirectly based on the amount of investment
23
banking revenue they helped generate. This created a conflict of interest for research
analysts who had an incentive to help win investment banking deals for CSFB while they
24
were also expected to issue objective research regarding those companies.
25
Specifically, equity research analysts were paid up to three percent of the net revenue
1
generated by an investment banking deal, with a maximum bonus of $250,000 per deal.
Some equity research analysts were also guaranteed a minimum bonus of either $15,000 or
2
$20,000 for the investment banking deals on which they worked, depending on whether
CSFB was lead or co-manager of the deal. This compensation was not part of the annual
3
bonus, but was pursuant to employment contracts, paid on a quarterly basis. This program
was initiated to provide an incentive for research analysts to assist in winning investment
banking business. According to the Director of Equity Research:
4
the head of equity capital markets and investment banking, felt that they
5
needed some help in '98 in generating additional help on investment
banking transactions or at least having analysts feel that it was somewhat
6
part of their compensation.
7
B. The actual amount paid to a research analyst was based on the level of contribution that
the research analyst made in connection with investment banking deals, as decided with
8
input from the investment bankers. The conflict was evident in the reviews performed by
investment bankers as well as self-reviews prepared by research analysts.
9
C. In evaluating the performance of equity research analysts to determine their
10
compensation, investment bankers used a form that judged the analyst by origination of the
deal, execution of the deal, and follow-through. Each section allowed for handwritten
11
comments and called for the investment banker to rank the research analyst from one to
three.
12
D. In one such evaluation, an investment banker wrote that the research analyst's ""input
and track record was critical to winning this business [The analyst] performed at her
13
normal high level making a lot of investor calls he analyst's] initiation of research
coverage was timely and insightful. She has been a supporter of the stock despite difficult
14
Internet environment.""
15
Technology Group Research
16
E. From July 1998 until December 2001, equity research analysts employed in the
Technology Group were compensated, in part, based on their contribution to investment
17
banking deals. The vast majority of equity research analysts' compensation was derived
from the bonus received rather than the base salary. At CSFB, it was not uncommon for a
18
more senior level Technology Group research analyst to have a salary of $100,000 -
$250,000, and also receive a bonus of $5,000,000 - $10,000,000 or higher. The
19
Technology Group bonus pool was funded by fifty percent of technology-related investment
banking revenues minus select expenses (including mergers and acquisitions) as well as a
20
percentage of revenue generated by secondary sales and trading in technology stocks, and
a percentage of Technology PCS revenues. In determining the allocation for each analyst,
the Director of Technology Research stated that he would review revenue generated with
21
respect to each company followed by the analyst, including revenues relating to banking,
sales, trading, derivatives, high yield, private placements, and specialty gains on the desk.
22
That amount of revenue formed the ""starting point"" of determining an individual's bonus,
after which additional factors such as the analysts' rating in polls were considered. The
23
Director of Technology Research made an initial recommendation regarding the bonus
component of a research analyst's compensation. The final decision was made by three
24
people: Quattrone, and the heads of the Technology Group Mergers and Acquisitions and
Corporate Finance departments.
25
1
F. The influence of investment banking revenue to the bonus is evidenced in an e-mail from
Quattrone to Technology Group officers, including officers in the research department. The
2
subject line of the e-mail included ""Please submit your revenue sheets if you want the
highest bonus possible."" In the e-mail, Quattrone wrote in part, ""Your trusty management
3
team is meeting
to determine compensation for the group...."" The message then urged
all the officers to submit a list of the banking deals they participated in so as to ensure a
complete list for determining compensation. The emphasis on a research analyst's
4
contribution to investment banking revenues, along with the influence of Quattrone and
other department head in determining compensation, created a conflict of interest for
5
analysts who were charged with the responsibility of preparing and issuing objective
research reports.
6
e. Investment Bankers Evaluated Research Analysts' Performance, Thereby
7
Influencing Their Bonuses and Compromising Research Analysts'
Independence
8
A. From July 1998 through 2001, investment bankers who worked with equity research
9
analysts on investment banking deals, in both the Equity and Technology Groups,
participated in the analysts' annual performance evaluations, which in turn affected analysts'
10
bonuses. This input from investment bankers provided a further incentive to equity research
analysts to satisfy the needs of investment bankers and their clients, and placed additional
11
pressure on research analyst to compromise their independence.
B. In 2000, CSFB investment bankers used a specific form in order to evaluate equity
12
research analysts, entitled ""Evaluation By Banking and Equity Capital Markets
Professionals."" On the form, investment bankers reviewed the work of specific research
13
analysts under different categories and provided an overall ranking for the analyst.
14
C. As an example, in one section called ""Business Leadership,"" an investment banker
wrote of a research analyst: ""Coordinates ideas in support of Banking Business; good
15
commercial instinct. Develops and utilizes relationships with client Senior Management,
including CEO's, in pursuing business. Represents firm well.'
16
D. The conflict between conducting objective research and attracting and retaining
17
investment banking clients was also evidenced in analysts' self-reviews. For example, one
analyst wrote in his self-evaluation: ""Trying to manage the research/banking balance.
18
Particularly challenging for me given the amount of banking we do and our dominant
banking franchise that has deep roots at CSFB.""
19
f. CSFB's Technology Research Analysts Played a Key Role at Investment
20
Banking ""Pitches"" to Help CSFB Win Investment Banking Deals - Including
at Times the Implicit Promise of Favorable Research
21
A. Between July 1998 and 2001, Technology Group research analysts played a key role in
helping to win investment banking business for CSFB. Once CSFB's technology bankers -
22
with the assistance of the technology research analysts - determined that a company was
a
strong candidate for an offering, a technology research analyst assisted in CSFB's sales
23
""pitch"" to the company, in which CSFB would explain why it should be chosen as the lead
managing underwriter for the offering. Quattrone described the relationship between the
24
technology research analysts and investment bankers as follows: ""[I]n many of the things
that we did with our clients, both groups [Technology Banking and Technology Research]
25
1
were involved. And the clients experienced CSFB, and in some sense both bankers and
analysts worked together in a collaborative fashion to deliver service to a client.""
2
B. As part of the sales pitch, technology research analysts prepared selling points
3
regarding their research to be included in the pitch books presented to the company. They
also routinely appeared with investment bankers at the pitches to help sell CSFB to the
potential client. The Director of Research for the Technology Group, described the
4
technology research analyst as- the ""star of the show"" at pitches. CSFB pitch books to
potential clients included representations about the role the technology research analyst
5
would play if CSFB obtained the business. The analyst's written and oral presentations, and
the presence of a research analyst at the pitch, strongly implied and at times implicitly
6
promised that CSFB would provide positive research if awarded the investment banking
business.
7
C. For example, in the pitch book for Numerical Technologies, the discussion regarding
8
research coverage headlined ""Easy Decision Strong Buy,' implicitly promising that CSFB
would issue a ""strong buy"" rating upon initiation of coverage. In another example, in a Fall
9
1999 pitch to a different technology company, CSFB's pitch book stated that the particular
CSFB technology research analyst who would cover the company ""[g]ets it,"" would ""pound
10
the table"" for the company, and would be the company's ""strongest advocate."" In addition,
the pitch book stated that research analyst would engage in ""pre-marketing one-on-one
11
meetings [with potential investors] prior to launch.""
D. In describing the ""Role of Research,"" the pitch book provided a roadmap for the amount
12
and type of coverage that the equity research department would issue in the first year after
initiating research, including some research issued at least monthly, and inclusion of the
13
company's stock as a ""focus stock."" The pitch book noted that CSFB's equity research
department would also provide (a) "" 'front-end' effort to position the company's
14
story in a prospectus and at roadshows""; (b) a "" force ""teach-in' to begin
communicating the [company's] opportunity to investors""; (c) ""active involvement on
15
roadshow""; (d) ""[d]irect follow-up with key investors after one-on-one meetings""; and (e)
""standalone"" company reports.
16
E. In another pitchbook, CSFB highlighted that it maintained the highest post-IPO trading
17
volume in a company whose public offering it led while noting that other investment banks
did not maintain similar trading volume for their banking clients. At the same time, CSFB
18
highlighted that its research analysts maintained a ""strong buy"" rating even though the
company announced results below estimates. In the pitchbook, CSFB distinguished itself
19
from other deal managers who were shown to have reduced their ratings based upon that
financial information. CSFB implied through this pitchbook that the firm would maintain
20
positive research for companies that have entered into investment banking deals with
CSFB.
21
g. Equity Research Analysts Were at Times Pressured by Investment Bankers
to Initiate or Maintain Positive Research Coverage
22
A. CSFB investment bankers, including senior bankers, at times pressured research
23
analysts to initiate or maintain coverage on companies to further ongoing or potential
investment banking relationships. Bankers at times applied undue pressure on equity
24
research analysts to initiate research on companies they otherwise would not have covered,
maintain ratings they otherwise would have lowered, and maintain coverage of companies
25
they otherwise would have dropped, but for the investment banking relationship.
1
B. In June 1999, CSFB's Technology Group investment bankers learned from a corporate
2
official at Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. (""Gemstar"") that the company was interested
in conducting a secondary offering of its stock. Company officials informed the CSFB
3
investment bankers that publication of research by CSFB was a prerequisite to CSFB being
named the investment banker for the planned offering. A Technology Group investment
banker informed the company official that CSFB would initiate coverage by July. The
4
investment banker then informed the analyst of the potential investment banking business
and noted that it was conditioned on CSFB initiating research for the company. When the
5
research analyst informed the investment banker that other obligations, including
administrative responsibilities, would keep him from conducting the necessary research in
6
the time frame mentioned by the banker, Quattrone challenged the research analyst's
priorities and directed that he conduct the review of the company on a more aggressive
7
schedule.
8
C. On June 15, 1999, an investment banker in the Technology Group wrote an e-mail to the
research analyst with a copy to Quattrone, stating that one of Gemstar's representatives
9
had:
10
adamantly stated that there will be no [investment banking] transaction without
prior research. As you know [another Gemstar representative] has also
11
expressed this same sentiment with regards to working on CSFB. We informed
[the Gemstar representative] that you intend to initiate coverage by July, which
12
would facilitate a September offering. The main takeaway from the meeting
was that there is an opportunity for a very large secondary offering in the second
13
half of this year. We need research for this to happen.
D. Later that day, the research analyst e-mailed the investment banker, with a copy to
14
Quattrone, stating that he could not even look at the matter for almost another three weeks,
given his need to study for an examination. In response to that e-mail, Quattrone instructed
15
the research analyst by e-mail to ""take a day off from your test prep and go down this week
or next."" Quattrone then e-mailed the chain of messages to the heads of other Technology
16
Group departments and another individual, noting that Quattrone was ""trying to shame"" the
research analyst into conducting the due diligence and ultimately initiating research
17
coverage of the company without delay.
18
E. Another example of this kind of conduct relates to Allaire Corp. (""Allaire""), which
develops and supports software for a variety of web applications. In January 1999, CFSB
19
acted as the lead manager for Allaire's IPO, earning more than $3.5 million from the
offering. CSFB was also the lead manager of a secondary offering for Allaire in September
20
1999. The total fees for that offering exceeded $10 million. On February 19, 1999, CSFB
initiated coverage of Allaire with a ""buy"" rating. CSFB continued to cover and issue
21
research on Allaire until the research analyst covering the company left CSFB in April 2000.
At the time of his departure when the stock was trading at approximately $130 per share,
22
the research analyst had a buy rating on the company. Another research analyst was
tapped to assume coverage of Allaire at that time.
23
F. The new research analyst's assumption of coverage was delayed and, as of early July
2000, the analyst assigned to cover Allaire had issued no new research on the company. In
24
a July 17, 2000 e-mail to Quattrone, the Head of Technology Research, and others, a CSFB
investment banker insisted that ""[w]e need to do everything in our power to ensure that"" the
25
new research analyst ""initiates coverage on Allaire."" In that e-mail, the investment banker
1
noted, among other things, that CSFB had received favorable fees and splits in connection
with its underwriting services for the IPO, the secondary and another transaction and that
2
Allaire's CEO was unhappy with CSFB's research sponsorship of Allaire since late 1999. 14, In
a responsive e-mail, Quattrone stated: ""We need to make this happen asap."" On August
2000, a new research analyst assumed coverage of Allaire, maintaining the previous
3
analyst's a buy rating while the stock was trading between $30 - $35 per share. A month
later, on September 18, 2000, once the stock had dropped below $10 per share, the
4
research analyst downgraded the stock to a ""hold"" rating.
5
G. On one occasion, Quattrone urged certain bankers and research analysts to threaten to
drop coverage of a company in an effort to obtain the lead manager position for an
6
investment banking offering. In January 2000, CSFB was attempting to obtain a lead
7
Aether had offered CSFB only the co-manager role, and not the bookrunner position for the
manager position for Aether Systems, Inc. (""Aether""). When Quattrone was informed that
offering, Quattrone attempted to use his authority by stating in a January 29, 2000 e-mail to
8
investment bankers and research analysts:
9
[N]o
way do we accept this proposal. [P]lease discuss with me [and
others] first thing in the morning. [W]e have agreed on the script, which is
10
books or walk and drop coverage.
h. CSFB Technology Group's Practice of Allowing Equity Research Analysts to
11
Discuss a Proposed Rating with Company Executives in Advance of Publishing
the Rating Caused Undue Pressure to Initiate or Maintain Positive Research
12
Coverage, and at Times Compromised Equity Research Analyst Independence
13
A. CSFB Technology Group allowed its research analysts to provide executives of
companies for whom they were about to issue research, with copies of analyses and
14
proposed ratings of their reports for editorial comment prior to dissemination. Technology
Group research analysts provided this information, in part, in an attempt to maintain their
15
good standing with the company. This type of direct interaction between analysts and
issuers provided additional pressure on the equity research analysts and at times
16
compromised the independence of the research analysts.
17
B. For example, on October 29, 1999, while preparing to re-initiate coverage for Razorfish,
Inc. (""RAZF""), a Technology Group research analyst wrote to the RAZF CEO:
18
With icube about to close, we need to think about resuming coverage of the
19
fish. I want your opinion on rating. We would have taken you to a strong buy
but given the recent stock run, does it make sense for us to now keep
the
20
upgrade in our back pocket in case we need it? Either way, I don't care. You
guys deserve it, I just don't want to waste it.
21
C. The CEO of RAZF responded to the research analyst, stating: ""1 think we should re-
initiate with a buy and a higher price target and keep the upgrade for a little while
22
Although its [sic] getting hard to justify the valuations.""
23
D. In this case, the research analyst re-initiated coverage on November 3, 1999 with a
strong buy rating when the stock was trading at $34. He reiterated and maintained that
24
strong buy from January 12, 2000, when the stock was trading at $39 per share, until
October 27, 2000, when he finally lowered his rating to a buy rating when the stock was
25
trading at $4. The research analyst maintained that buy rating until May 4, 2001, when
1
RAZF was trading at just $ 1.14. At that time, he once again downgraded to a hold rating.
2
3. CSFB Issued Fraudulent Equity Research Reports on Two Companies in the
Technology Sector: Digital Impact and Synopsys. Those Reports Were Unduly
3
Influenced by Investment Banking Considerations
4
The undue, improper influence that investment banking exerted over research analysts
caused technology research analysts to issue fraudulent research reports on two
companies, Digital Impact and Synopsys. Specifically, investment bankers pressured
5
research analysts to initiate or maintain positive research coverage of these two companies
in order to obtain or retain investment banking business. The analysts were pressured or
6
compelled to compromise their own professional opinions regarding companies at the
direction of the firm's investment bankers.
7
a. Digital Impact, Inc.
8
A. Digital Impact, Inc. (""DIGI"") is a company involved in online direct marketing. CSFB
9
acted as the lead manager for the DIGI IPO in November 1999, earning more than $5
million from the offering. Following the IPO, a CSFB technology research analyst initiated
10
coverage with a ""buy"" rating. At that time, DIGI traded for just under $50 per share.
Between January 2000 and April 2001, as the stock price declined to less than $2 per share,
11
CSFB maintained either a ""buy"" or a ""strong buy"" rating on the stock.
12
B. In May 2001, after the original analyst. had left CSFB, a senior research analyst in the
Technology Group was assigned coverage of DIGI. At that time, DIGI was trading for less
13
than $2 per share. CSFB assumed coverage and ""buy"" ratings in June and July 2001.
Thereafter, the senior research analyst then met with the company and determined that he
14
wanted to drop coverage of DIGI, noting that DIGI's ""market opportunity was just very
competitive
and
they were going to have
a difficult time thriving in that
environment.""
15
C. The senior research analyst attempted to drop coverage of DIGI on two occasions. On
16
both attempts, the senior research analyst acceded to requests from an investment banker
in the Technology Group that he not drop coverage. In a September 4, 2001 e-mail, the
17
senior research analyst informed two investment bankers of his continued desire to drop
coverage of DIGI. That day, one of the investment bankers responded:
18
I think [the other investment bankers] will ask for continued cov'g on DIGI
19
given ongoing relationship, good [venture capitalists] and CSFB led IPO.
20
D. Despite his own desire to drop coverage of the stock, the research analyst acceded to
the desires of the investment banker and did not drop coverage on DIGI. The research
21
analyst maintained coverage, and left the ""buy"" rating unchanged until October 2, 2001,
when CSFB downgraded DIGI to a ""hold"" rating.
22
b. Synopsys, Inc.
23
A. Internal e-mail correspondence among research analysts regarding Synopsys shows
that the pressure imposed by investment bankers on research analysts to initiate or maintain
24
favorable coverage was not an isolated problem at CSFB. In May 2001, a technology
research analyst wrote an e-mail to the Head of Technology Research, complaining of:
25
1
Unwritten Rules for Tech Research: Based on the following set of specific
situations that have arisen in the past, I have ""learned' to adapt to a set of
2
rules that have been imposed by Tech Group banking so as to keep our
corporate clients appeased. I believe that these unwritten rules have clearly
3
hindered my ability to be an effective analyst in my various coverage sectors.
B. The research analyst wrote that, after downgrading a company in 1998, his investment
4
banking counterpart ""informed [him] of unwritten rule number one: that 'if you can't say
something positive, don't say anything at all."" Regarding a second company about which
5
he had reported in 1999, the analyst wrote that he:
6
issued some cautionary comments in the Tech Daily
CEO completely lost
his composure and swore to the banker, that [second company] would
7
never do any business with CSFB (another GS client we were trying to court).
At the time, [the investment banker] informed me of unwritten rule number
8
two: 'why couldn't you just go with the flow of the other analysts, rather than
try to be a contrarian?
9
C. The technology research analyst applied these ""unwritten rules"" to Synopsys, which he
10
had rated as a ""strong buy"" from July 1999 through June 2000. Specifically, the technology
research analyst wrote that he
11
a down-tick in guidance coming and wanted to moderate rating
12
from strong buy to buy. However, banking felt this might impact CSFB's ability
to potentially do business with the company downstream. By following rules
1
& 2, I had successfully managed not to annoy the company, or banking.
13
D. Based on these incidents, the analyst concluded that he was ""not naïve enough to lack a
14
sense of appreciation of the role of investment banking (and banking fees) for the franchise.""
15
4. CSFB Issued Research on Four Companies that Lacked a Reasonable Basis,
Made Exaggerated or Unwarranted Claims, was Imbalanced, or Lacked Full and
16
Accurate Disclosures
17
As to four companies, CSFB's equity research analysts issued research that lacked a
reasonable basis for the claims made, made exaggerated or unwarranted claims, failed to
18
provide a balanced presentation of the relevant facts, and/or failed to disclose important
information about the company or CSFB's and its research analyst's relationship to the
19
company.
20
a. Numerical Technologies, Inc.
21
A. In April 2000, CSFB acted as lead manager on the IPO of Numerical Technologies for
which it received a fee of more than $5.4 million. Following the IPO, a Technology Group
research analyst informed a company official that he planned to initiate coverage with a
22
""buy"" rating. The official complained about the proposed rating to an investment banker at
CSFB. According to the analyst, the investment banker successfully urged the analyst,
23
""against [the analyst's] better judgment,"" to initiate coverage with a ""strong buy"" rating.
24
b. Agilent Technologies, Inc.
25
A. In certain instances, CSFB equity research analysts maintained positive ratings in
1
published research reports, while conveying a more negative outlook regarding the stock to
their institutional customers within the text of the written research reports. In describing the
2
ratings used from July 1998 through 2001 and beyond, research analysts did not use the
same description of the rating as CSFB's published description. According to one senior
3
research analyst:
Different analysts have different ways they would interpret a hold rating
And I
4
think it's probably fair to say that for a number of analysts, particularly because of
the fear of backlash that we get from a company
or
that we get from
5
institutional investors, there would be a hesitancy to use the ""sell"" rating.
So
analysts did have a tendency to somehow use a hold with more of a negative
6
slant to it.
7
[T]he monthly review and comment we would verbally describe what we meant
by each of the four ratings that I mentioned before. But there was a lot of latitude
8
left to the individual analyst to kind of use the rating I don't want to say in a
custom tailored way, but certainly there would be some judgment applied by the
9
analyst in terms of how they would use this specific rating to their sector.
10
B. This approach manifested itself with regard to Agilent Technologies, Inc. CSFB was the
co-manager for the November 17, 1999 IPO, earning more than $5.7 million in fees. A
11
technology research analyst initiated coverage of the company with a ""buy"" rating on
December 13, 1999. On July 21, 2000, the analyst reiterated his ""buy"" rating, while also
12
describing in his research report that the company had announced that its healthcare
business was likely to have an operating loss at least as wide as the previous quarter's loss
of $30 million. The report reiterating the ""buy"" rating also disclosed in the body of the report
13
that the company announced that third quarter earnings would be 18-22 cents per share,
compared to the 35 cents average estimate of analysts polled.
14
C. The report also indicated that:
15
Agilent is rated Buy, only in the most generous sense, though in the short
16
term we would only buy it on extreme weakness, with a 12-24 month time
horizon. Our near-term concern is that problems are not typically resolved in
17
one or two quarters.
18
D. CSFB maintained its ""buy"" rating until February 2001 when it finally downgraded to
""hold."" This came only after Agilent preannounced second quarter revenues and suspended
19
earnings guidance for the remainder of the year, citing a ""dramatic slowdown in customer
demand."" CSFB's positive rating of Agilent for an extended period of time despite negative
20
news was cited by a research analyst in CSFB as an example of maintaining a positive
rating while signaling negative news to large institutional clients.
21
E. Following the July 21, 2000 report on Agilent, a CSFB technology research analyst cited
the coverage of Agilent to another CSFB research analyst who was facing some ""tough
22
decisions"" on rating two companies that CSFB had helped take public. The first analyst
noted that he wanted to give one of the companies a neutral rating but was ""wondering how
23
to approach this based on banking sensitivities.' The other analyst responded suggesting
that the analyst ""ask [the analyst who covered Agilent for the July 21, 2000 report] about the
24
""Agilent Two-Step'. That's where in writing you have a buy rating (like we do on [the other
company], and thank God it's not a strong buy) but verbally everyone knows your position.'

Date
11
CSFB Lacked a Reasonable Basis for the $79 Target Price
12
E. In three reports between March 1, 2001 and April 5, 2001, when CSFB suspended its
13
rating for Winstar, CSFB's $79 target price for the company was not reasonable. The target
price failed to reflect Winstar's deteriorating stock price, extensive funding needs, likely
14
changes in fundamentals, and over-leveraged balance sheet, as well as the bleak capital
markets environment. The target price of $79 per share represented unreasonably high
15
returns:
16
3/01/01 -- actual price: $12.5000
% Upside:
632%
3/13/01 -- actual price: $ 7.6875
% Upside: 1028%
17
4/03/01 -- actual price: $ 0.3125
% Upside: 25,280%
18
F. From March 1, 2001 forward, CSFB's target price was more than 50 percent higher than
the target price of any other firm covering Winstar.
19
G. Reports issued in 2001 also failed to disclose that the terms ""target price,"" ""price
objective,"" or ""percentage upside"" did not represent the price at which CSFB believed
20
Winstar stock would be trading in 12 months. Instead, CSFB used those terms to reflect the
theoretical value of Winstar's worth in 12 months if a buyer valued Winstar using CSFB's
21
valuation methodology. CSFB, however, failed to disclose that it was using the terms in this
manner.
22
CSFB Failed Adequately to Disclose Significant Risks of Investing in Winstar
23
H. The January 5, 2001, January 8, 2001, and March 1, 2001 reports failed adequately to
24
disclose the risks of investing in Winstar, particularly the risks related to funding, including
Winstar's need to raise more than $3 billion to fund its business plan to reach a free cash
25
flow positive status and the risk that Winstar might not be able to raise the necessary funds.
1
March 13, 2001 research report, CSFB again failed adequately to disclose the risks
of than investing $3 billion, the report significantly downplayed the risk that Winstar might not be able
I. In a in Winstar. While disclosing for the first time that Winstar needed to raise more to
2
do so:
3
[W]e maintain our forecast that WCII is funded into 1Q02
While we
currently forecast that WCII needs over $3B of additional capital to reach a
4
free cash flow positive status, WCII management effectively laid to rest
many of the recent concerns that we have been hearing from investors,
5
including the quality of WCII's balance sheet as well as the company's
funding status.
6
While CSFB research reports identified certain issues relating to funding, those reports CSFB
7
J. did not adequately disclose funding risks or other concerns regarding funding that analyst
equity analysts discussed in internal e-mails. On February 8, 2001, a CSFB equity
8
sent an e-mail with a chart showing Winstar's cash flows. The e-mail stated:
9
this is FYI
I worked this up to convince myself that wcii was indeed funded
through
FY01 I've included everything I know about for them over the next
10
year, and it looks like they have $185M left at the end of the year.
11
K. Such analysis should have been included in CSFB's disseminated research in order to
present a balanced picture of the risks of investing in Winstar.
12
L. On March 22, 2001, CSFB's senior Winstar equity research analyst e-mailed CLEC a
13
customer, who had raised questions about investor concerns and funding in the
sector. The analyst acknowledged in his e-mail that there were funding concerns.
14
M. On April 5, 2001 when Winstar's price closed at $0.44, CSFB issued a report
15
suspending its rating. In the report, CSFB explained that the suspension was:
16
following the announcement of a major scale back in the firm's expansion
plans but without any positive developments on the much anticipated drive to
secure additional sources of funding - both equity and network capacity sales.
17
Given WCII's lack of balance sheet flexibility due to approximately $360M of
cash interest obligations in FY01 (growing to over $400M in FY02) and the
18
current bleak capital markets environment, we believe that a significant
balance sheet restructuring is one of the only situation under which the
19
company can avoid more draconian scenarios.
20
N. CSFB had not adequately disclosed in earlier reports the concerns mentioned in the
April 5, 2001 report.
21
d. NPW
22
A. CSFB at times had a proprietary interest in NPW that was not disclosed in research
23
reports issued by the firm. Further, CSFB research analysts covering NPW also had
24
the published reports. The ownership interests of the firm and the research analysts created
personal proprietary interests in the company but the firm failed to disclose those interests in
a conflict of interest that should have been disclosed.
25
1
B. NPW was incorporated in November 1999 as EMW Energy Services Corporation, a
division of Enron Energy Services (a division of Enron Corporation (""Enron"")). Until January
2
6, 2000, Enron held all issued and outstanding shares of NPW. NPW's business was to
provide natural gas and electricity to retail customers in newly deregulated state markets
3
while obtaining the gas and electricity wholesale from Enron. In January and July 2000, DLJ
assisted with two private placements for NPW and received approximately $1 million in
4
investment banking revenues. DLJ invested $42.5 million in the two private placements
through its affiliated partnerships, known as the ""DLJ Merchant Banking Partnerships,"" in
return for approximately 9.7 percent of NPW.
5
C. On October 5, 2000, NPW conducted an IPO and offered 24 million shares at $21 per
6
share. DLJ and CSFB were the joint lead underwriters and earned approximately $15.7
million in fees. After the IPO, CSFB, through its acquisition of DLJ, owned 7.9 percent of
7
NPW, while Enron owned 44 percent of the company. In 2000, CSFB and DLJ combined
received approximately more than $12.4 million in investment banking revenues from Enron.
8
In 2001, CSFB received approximately $21.6 million in investment banking revenues from
Enron. From October 2000 to November 2001, CSFB issued 18 ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy""
9
research reports on NPW. CSFB failed to disclose its proprietary interest in NPW in four of
these research reports issued to the public during that period.
10
D. Also during that period, the senior research analyst covering NPW held undisclosed
11
investments in NPW. The senior analyst invested approximately $21,000 of his own money,
which was leveraged 5:1 by CSFB, in NPW through DLJ partnerships that owned NPW
12
shares. In addition, an associate research analyst who assisted in preparing the reports,
and whose name appeared on the reports, held 200 shares of NPW from November 7,
2000, to June 14, 2001. From October 2000 to November 2001, CSFB did not disclose
13
either of the research analysts' financial interests in NPW in the 18 NPW research reports
issued to the public.
14
6.CSFB's Technology PCS Group Engaged In Improper IPO ""Spinning"" Allocations
15
to Corporate Executives of Investment Banking Clients
16
A. Quattrone established the Technology PCS (Private Client Services) Group to be part of
the Technology Group. The Director of Technology PCS had a primary and direct reporting
17
responsibility to Quattrone with a secondary ""dotted-line' reporting responsibility to the
Director of CSFB's PCS Department. Technology PCS focused exclusively on the
18
technology sector. Technology PCS operated independently of CSFB's other PCS brokers.
The Technology PCS client base consisted, almost exclusively, of officers of investment
19
banking clients of the Technology Group.
20
B. From approximately March 1999 through April 2001, Technology PCS improperly
allocated ""hot"" IPO stock to executives of investment banking clients and improperly
21
managed the purchase and sale of that stock through discretionary trading accounts.
CSFB's Technology Group gave improper preferential treatment to these company
executives with the belief and expectation that the executives would steer investment
22
banking business for their companies to CSFB.
23
C. These executives profited from their allocations of ""hot"" IPO stock. During this time
period, the share value of the technology-related IPOs in which CSFB served as
24
bookrunning manager increased dramatically, with the average share price increase in the
immediate aftermarket exceeding 99 percent. In some instances, the aftermarket trading
25
was significantly higher. On December 9, 1999, for example, IPO shares of VA Linux
1
Systems stock, which had a public offering price (""POP"") of $30 per share, closed after the
first day of aftermarket trading at $239.25 per share, representing a 698 percent increase
over the offering price. Technology PCS began selling its clients' VA Linux IPO shares on
a
2
discretionary basis when the stock was at $227 per share. Technology PCS allocated
3
92,000 VA Linux IPO shares to 110 discretionary accounts. Within one day of the offering,
the Technology PCS brokers sold 41,400 shares (representing approximately 45 percent
of
the Technology PCS allocation) out of the discretionary accounts, resulting in one-day
4
realized profits of almost $6.4 million.
5
a.
Discretionary Accounts were Established for ""Strategic"" Executive Officers
of Issuers
6
A. Pitchbooks used by the Technology Group to win an issuer's investment banking
7
business referenced the discretionary accounts. Consistent with those references and
representations made at ""pitches,"" an issuer had to award CSFB its investment banking
8
mandate before the issuer's officers were afforded the opportunity to open discretionary
accounts and given access to IPO shares by CSFB. Likewise, CSFB considered ways to
9
reduce or eliminate IPO allocations to executives who changed employment and were no
longer affiliated with those companies.
10
B. Once Technology Group received a mandate, Technology PCS established
11
discretionary accounts for executives who were considered to be ""strategic.' ""Strategic"" was
commonly understood by Quattrone and Technology PCS managers to refer to the overall
business relationship CSFB had with the issuer, including potential future investment
12
banking business. The head of Technology PCS defined ""strategic as ""senior decision
makers"" at existing or prospective investment banking clients of the Technology Group who
13
could influence their companies' choice of investment banker. The accounts were ranked
based on the executive's perceived influence in this regard, and ""hot"" IPO shares were
14
allocated based on the ranking. Allocations ranged from 1200 shares for accounts ranked
one, to 300 shares for accounts ranked 4.
15
C. Technology PCS did not apply standard CSFB qualification standards (i.e. assets under
16
management, trading revenue production, length of the brokerage relationship, etc.) for the
opening of these discretionary accounts. Instead, the decision was based largely on the
17
executive's position and influence at the company. Technology PCS established a minimum
funding level of $100,000 that was subsequently raised to $250,000. Technology PCS also
18
set $250,000 as the maximum level of funds with which customers could fund the
discretionary accounts. These discretionary accounts were limited to the purchase and sale
19
of stock purchased through CSFB IPOs. The account holders were not permitted to buy or
sell other securities in these accounts, as a result of which Technology PCS turned away
millions of dollars of potential customer investments. The number of discretionary accounts
20
serviced by Technology PCS reached a peak in 2000 of approximately 285.
21
b. Technology PCS Allocated Shares in Every IPO to the Discretionary
Accounts and ""Flipped"" Stock out of the Accounts, Generating Large
22
Trading Profits for the Favored Executives
23
A. The Technology PCS Group allocated shares to the discretionary accounts in every IPO
in which the Technology Group was involved. Senior Technology Group managers
24
participated in determining allocations to discretionary accounts and deciding for whom such
accounts were to be opened. The overwhelming majority of those IPOs were ""hot.'
25
Technology PCS personnel decided when and how many IPO shares to sell from the
1
discretionary accounts. In some cases, all the shares allocated to discretionary accounts
were sold for a profit on the IPO's first day of trading in the secondary market. In other
2
cases, half the shares were sold within one or two days of the offering and the remaining
half sold sometime later. In virtually all instances, the ""flipping"" of IPO shares out of the
3
discretionary accounts resulted in the account holders receiving substantial profits with no
individual effort and minimal market risk.
4
B. The table below provides examples of the extraordinary gains realized in these
discretionary accounts and correlates them with the investment banking fees paid to CSFB

c. Unofficial ""Performance Reports"" were Developed and Distributed by
Technology PCS Group Personnel to the Account Holders
13
A. Technology PCS prepared unofficial ""Performance Reports"" measuring the extraordinary
14
performance of these discretionary accounts and furnished the reports to the discretionary
account holders. These reports, distributed monthly, showed, among other things, the
15
length of time the account had been open, the amount of contributions to the account, the
total gain in the account (before fees) and the account's rate of return. These unofficial
reports were meant to ensure that the discretionary account holders were aware of the
16
extraordinary gains being generated for them through the flipping of IPO shares. Some
show total gains over the life of the account exceeding $1 million. One report shows that in
17
little more than a year and a half (September 19, 1999 to June 8, 2001), the account had a
rate of return in excess of 3,800%.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Alaska division of banking, securities, and corporations
(the ""Division""), as administrator of the Act, hereby enters this Order:
22
FINDINGS OF FACT
23
A. Background
24
1. This action concerns the period of July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2001 (the ""relevant
25
period""). During that time, several JPMSI predecessor entities engaged in both
research and investment banking (""IB"") activities.
1
1.
Research analysts were responsible for providing analyses of the financial outlook
of particular companies in the context of the business sectors in which those
2
companies operated and the securities market as a whole.
3
2.
Research analysts evaluated companies by, among other things, examining
financial and other information contained in public filings; questioning company
4
management; investigating customer and supplier relationships; evaluating
companies' business plans and the products or services offered; building financial
5
models; and analyzing competitive trends.
6
3.
After synthesizing and analyzing this information, research analysts drafted
research reports and more abbreviated ""notes"" that typically contained a
7
recommendation, a price target, and a summary and analysis of the factors upon
which the analyst relied in issuing the price target and recommendation.
8
4.
The Firm published research on publicly traded companies, and this research was
9
distributed to the Firm's institutional and private equity customers. Published
10
research was made available through mailing lists, the Firm's website, and
subscription services provided by First Call. In addition, the research was made
available to some retail customers of another broker dealer and offered via
11
websites offering brokerage and investment services.
12
5.
In addition to performing these research functions, certain research analysts
13
participated in IB activities.
14
6.
These IB activities included identifying and/or vetting companies as prospects for
IB services, participating in pitches of IB services to companies, participating in
15
""roadshows"" associated with underwriting transactions, and speaking to investors
to generate interest in underwriting transactions.
1
16
7.
These IB activities also included participating in commitment committee and due
17
diligence activities in connection with underwriting transactions and assisting the
IB Department in providing merger and acquisition (""M&A"") and other advisory
18
services to companies.
19
8.
The Firm encouraged all research analysts to support its businesses, including the
Firm's IB business, and in some cases, research analysts were expected to
20
participate in the foregoing IB activities. The level of analyst participation in these
IB activities was sometimes significant.
21
9.
For example, in an e-mail dated May 23, 2000, and sent by a research analyst to
22
the Head of Research at RESPONDENT JPMSI, the analyst requested approval
to hire another junior analyst. The analyst stated: ""I'd like to get yet another
23
24
1 A ""roadshow"" is a series of presentations made to potential investors in conjunction with the marketing of an
25
upcoming underwriting.
2
The ""commitment committee"" was responsible for, among other things, evaluating and then either approving
or rejecting the Firm's participation in initial public offerings (""IPOs"") and other IB transactions.
1
junior The deals are really dragging me down, and I'm not spending nearly
enough time with buy-side clients. Even though the market is crap, we continue to
2
process deals in hopes of market recovery. I am trying to remove myself from the
day-to-day production of research. I actually like doing it, but it's not what you pay
3
me for."" (Emphasis in the original.)
4
10.
IB business was an important source of revenue for the Firm. In 2000, the
combined operating revenues for JPM and Chase totaled $32.793 billion, and the
5
combined revenues for the Equity Capital Markets (""ECM"") and the M&A
Departments at JPM and Chase totaled $1.687 billion.
6
D. Participation in Investment Banking Activities Was a Factor in Evaluating and
7
Compensating Research Analysts
8
1.
The compensation system at the Firm provided an incentive for research analysts
to participate in IB activities and to assist in generating IB business for the Firm.
9
2.
10
The performance of research analysts was evaluated by the Head of Research
through an annual review process and, where not set by contract in advance, the
11
research analyst's bonus was determined through this process.
12
3.
The Head of Research evaluated the research analysts' job performance through
responses to self-evaluation forms; surveys of the sales force; input from the IB,
13
Sales, and Trading departments; consideration of market factors and rankings by
investor publications; and, in some cases, written ""team reviews"" submitted by
14
individual investment bankers.
15
4.
The self-evaluation forms contained questions on areas constituting the major
allocations of research analysts' time, including questions relating to participation
16
in IB activities.
17
5.
In response to questions relating to participation in IB activities, research analysts
reported one or more of the following: their IB activities, accomplishments, and
18
goals; their participation in lead- and co-managed underwritings; and the fees
associated with IB transactions on which the analyst worked.
19
6.
For example, the ""Investment Banking Activities"" section of a 1999 self-evaluation
20
form queried: ""In what way have you assisted in discovering or executing banking
transactions (i.e., due diligence sessions, pitches)? Be specific."" In response, a
21
research analyst stated: ""Helped put together and develop pitch books for KV
Pharma and King Pharmaceuticals;"" ""Helping to come up with creative ideas and
22
contributing to brainstorming sessions with bankers - ad hoc and in biweekly
Monday meetings;"" ""Have a good handle on which companies will need financing
23
in the near future and stepping up research efforts to ensure a place for H&Q on
the cover;"" and ""Increasing responsibility in the office allows [another research
24
analyst] to travel and be more active in pitching and winning deals with new
companies.'
25
1
7.
In another example, a research analyst stated the following in response to IB
questions contained in his year 2000 self-evaluation form:
""Completed
21
2
investment banking deals, including 11 lead-managed deals Biotechnology new
issues have generated $70 million in primary fees in fiscal year 2000 YTD. In
3
2000 we were ranked #1 in healthcare common equity offerings by U.S. Issuers,
raising $3.9 billion and capturing 21.9% market share."" In addition, the analyst
4
listed all deals on which he worked that were ""Lead Managed,"" ""Co-managed,
""Pitched,"" and ""Pending.""
5
8.
The self-evaluation forms conveyed to research analysts some of the criteria used
6
to evaluate their performance. As reflected in the IB questions contained in the
forms, contribution to the Firm's IB business was an important part of the analyst's
7
job.
8
9.
In some circumstances, research analysts requested that individual investment
bankers complete a written ""team review"" of the analyst, which was then submitted
9
to the Head of Research. In these reviews, the investment banker described his
10
or her contact with the analyst and the analyst's participation in IB activities,
including pitch and underwriting activities.
11
10.
For example, in a 1999 review of a research analyst by an investment banker, the
12
banker stated the following: ""I have worked extensively with [this research analyst]
over the past year. I probably speak to her everyday [sic] on topics ranging from
13
executing live transactions, evaluating potential business opportunities, drafting
""pitch' presentations, coordinating scheduling and marketing efforts across IB, and
14
strategizing about the Internet practice I consider [her] to be a partner in
our
building of the firm's Internet franchise and, as a result, probably work more
15
closely with her than anyone in IB.""
16
11. Research analysts sometimes provided reviews of investment bankers in
conjunction with the banker's performance review. In these reviews, analysts
17
described their contact with the banker and referenced participation in specific IB
activities.
18
12.
For example, in an e-mail dated Dec. 14, 2000, a research analyst provided a
19
review of an investment banker. The analyst stated: ""I've probably had more
opportunity to work with [this investment banker] and observe him in action than
20
anybody else in the bank. [The banker and I] have been in sync about where the
quality banking prospects are so that I don't have to fend off garbage banking
21
deals
Built semiconductor banking practice from nothing:
[The banker
and I] have built a profitable semiconductor banking practice, starting from literally
22
zero four years ago In 1999, we posted a couple of successes With a touch
more luck, we could have doubled the revenue potential this year We are still
23
banking the semiconductor sector pretty much the way we did three years ago,
which means going after a dozen or so key prospects (split evenly between
24
existing public companies and quality IPO candidates) and then doing everything
else opportunistically rather than strategically The message here is that we have
25
not developed the semiconductor banking machine that our strongest dozen
1
competitors have, and that makes it hard to gain market share."" (Emphasis in the
original.)
2
13.
Based upon comments in the self-evaluations completed by research analysts and
3
the reviews completed by both analysts and investment bankers, the two groups
worked closely on IB transactions and shared a common goal of building the
4
Firm's IB business.
5
14.
The Head of Research reviewed the self-evaluations and team reviews and
provided a verbal and/or written evaluation of the research analyst. The written
6
evaluations provided feedback on the analyst's performance during the year and in
certain cases highlighted the analyst's participation in IB activities, including the
7
revenues generated by IB transactions on which the analyst worked.
8
15.
For example, the Head of Research at RESPONDENT JPMSI stated the following
9
in the first paragraph of his year 2000 evaluation of a research analyst: ""By every
measure, [the research analyst] had an outstanding year in 2000. Most
10
importantly, [he] led the charge in establishing J.P. Morgan as the #1 biotech shop
with a resounding 21.9% share of the underwriting wallet in his sector. [He]
11
supported 21 transactions this year, 11 of which were as the lead underwriter.
The revenue attributable to these transactions is over $70 mm."" Later in the
12
evaluation, the Head of Research stated that the analyst's contribution to the
Firm's ""corporate underwriting business"" was ""enormous.""
13
16. Comments by the Head of Research conveyed to research analysts the
14
performance areas that were important to research management and the Firm.
Based upon these comments, certain analysts were encouraged to participate in
15
IB activities, increase IB revenues, and enhance the reputation of the Firm's IB
franchise.
16
17. Research analyst bonuses were determined by the Head of Research in his
17
discretion after considering several factors that contributed to the analyst's market
value.
18
18. The research analyst's contribution to and impact on the Firm's IB business, and
19
the fees generated by IB transactions on which the analyst worked, were some of
the factors used to determine the analyst's bonus. If the analyst did not disclose in
20
the self- evaluation form the fees generated by the IB transactions on which he or
she worked, the Head of Research requested this information from the ECM
21
Department at the Firm.
22
E. Investment Banking Interests Influenced the Firm's Decision to Initiate and
Maintain Research Coverage
23
1.
In general, the Firm determined whether to initiate and maintain research
24
coverage based upon institutional investors' interest in the company and/or based
upon IB considerations, such as attracting companies to generate IB business or
25
maintaining a positive relationship with existing IB clients.
1
2.
Regarding companies for which the Firm lead- or co-managed an underwriting
transaction, research coverage was typically initiated and maintained for a period
2
of time beyond the transaction.
3
3.
The Head of Research was responsible for approval of the determination to issue,
maintain, and drop research coverage. The Head of Research solicited input from
4
other departments, including the IB Department, to determine the coverage
preferences of those departments. IB considerations sometimes played a role in
5
the decision to initiate and maintain research coverage.
6
4.
For example, after the merger of JPM and Chase, the Director of U.S. Equity
Research at RESPONDENT JPMSI sent an e-mail entitled: ""U.S. Equity
7
Research Organizational Announcement."" Attached was an internal memorandum
""outlining Investment Banking Coordination Responsibilities,"" which stated: ""One
8
of the important duties of the Director of Research is to work closely with
Investment Banking to ensure that research resources are appropriately aligned
9
with identified investment banking opportunities.""
10
5.
In addition, the Head of Research requested that research analysts obtain from
11
investment bankers lists of companies that the bankers wanted under coverage.
12
6.
For example, an e-mail dated November 4, 1999, from the Head of Research to all
equity research analysts, stated: ""[T]alk to your counterparts in IB and prepare a
13
list of the companies that they would like you to cover Please be sure to have a
conversation with the appropriate bankers before you submit your list.""
14
7.
Some research analysts and investment bankers actively coordinated the initiation
15
and maintenance of research coverage based upon, among other things, IB
considerations. This coordination consisted of meetings and communications by
16
telephone and e-mail.
17
8.
For example, a research analyst sent an e-mail, dated March 9, 2001, to the
Director of U.S. Equity Research at RESPONDENT JPMSI which stated:
18
""[Another research analyst] and I have prioritized the coverage area in
coordination with banking, and we are moving to a more targeted (no pun
19
intended) investor marketing plan which leverages our combined coverage We
are clearly focused on building both the brokerage and banking businesses We
20
are actively discussing trimming a couple of the less relevant of these companies
and replacing them with larger market capitalization firms which we can bank
In
21
total, I would look to us to initiate on two non-deal related stocks this year, keeping
the total names under coverage around the current level. In addition to two non-
22
deal initiations, we have mapped out the year and have planned original theme
pieces and other value-added activities for investors including non-deal related
23
road shows Banking: We already did KPMG, for which I believe we were paid
$12.5M. And we have been mandated as a senior co-manager on Accenture,
24
another large transaction. Beyond these, a likely opportunity later in the year is
Technology Partners International, an outsourcing consultant. We are well
25
positioned to lead this company's IPO. [An investment banker] leads the
coordinated banking effort covering the sector, and we are working closely with
1
[him] and the other coverage bankers to bank existing companies and to identify
quality early stage firms."" (Emphasis in the original.)
2
9.
In another example, an investment banker sent an e-mail, dated May 17, 2001, to
3
a group of biotechnology analysts and bankers to arrange a meeting to discuss
""coverage strategy."" The e-mail stated: ""On the heels of [a research analyst and
4
a banker] leaving, we probably need to discuss coverage strategy. Also would be
a good time to talk about where we might shake loose some business. M&A
5
ideas to pitch, IPOs coming in next wave etc.""
6
10.
In another example, a research analyst sent an e-mail, dated March 1, 2001, to
biotechnology analysts and the Head of U.S. Equity Research that contained the
7
following subject line: ""bankers wish list for biotech research."" The e-mail stated:
Attached is the culmination of the survey of bankers - as a reminder, / asked them
8
for
3 groups of names. 1. Companies we 'owe' research to since they paid us in
2000 and are not covered by research today. Most of these are from analysts who
9
have left (on the H&Q side) and we haven't even had research take a formal look
10
at some of these, which is obviously the first step for deciding on what to do. 2.
Public companies where bankers have a good relationship and think we can get
11
banking business if research is on board. The goal here is to have research
evaluate the story as soon as possible, so we can either go full bore on getting the
12
business, or re-assign bankers elsewhere if research is negative. 3. Private
companies that are focus names-we'll commit to have research spend time with
13
these companies as much as possible before the IPO to put us in the best position
possible to win the books. Also, research is going to add their own names if some
14
of their favorites were not mentioned by any of the bankers.'
15
11. The following e-mails reflect the IB influences in the initiation and maintenance of
research coverage as perceived by an individual research analyst.
16
12. In an e-mail dated November 2, 2000, a research analyst provided a team review
17
of an investment banker that stated the following: ""I have worked with [the banker]
on the International Rectifier (IRF) account since around mid-1998 and he
18
lobbied me very actively to pick up coverage so that JPM could go after the
banking business, especially equities but also potentially debt, M&A, etc. My
19
attitude initially was that IRF is a low-grade semiconductor company that would be
hard to sell to buy-side clients, but [he] kept pushing the banking
20
potential Finally, I picked up coverage in December 1998 Then, IRF threw
sand in our eyes by giving the lead to Morgan Stanley We picked up coverage
21
when they needed us most at the bottom of the semiconductor cycle and
supported the stock enormously. When the plum banking assignment came up
22
that would pay us back for our support, IRF handed the deal to MS, which had
zero history with the company.""
23
13. In an e-mail dated August 8, 2000, the same research analyst stated: ""Given how
24
thoroughly we just got screwed on IRF, [the Head of Research of RESPONDENT
JPMSI] is not interested in hearing stories about how if we initiate coverage, then
25
we will be considered for banking business. He wants to hear that the banking
business is locked up. We've been screwed too many times [O]ur not covering
1
IFX [Infineon Technologies] is a direct result of being offered money-losing table
scraps in the IPO I guess I'm still in the same old place. Initiating coverage of
2
IFX some time in the next six months is no problem, especially as [a research
analyst] is going to have to cover it eventually anyway. It doesn't make sense to
3
have a European semiconductor analyst that does not cover Infineon."" (Emphasis
in the original.)
4
14.
In addition, consideration of ""investment banking sensitivities"" was included in a
5
discussion of the Firm's ""Long Term Buy"" (""LTB"") research rating.
6
15.
An e-mail dated December 29, 2000, which was sent to all Chase H&Q research
analysts, including the Head of Research at Chase H&Q, described the stock
7
rating system to be used after the merger of JPM and Chase.
8
16. The e-mail's subject line stated: ""Public dissemination of coverage and Re-Rating
your stocks-IMPORTANT
The e-mail stated: The guidelines for
9
determining the rating are below Long-Term Buy: 0-10% outperformance
of the relevant benchmark target within a twelve to eighteen month time
10
frame. Shorter-term catalysts to explain the 'longer-term' nature of the
11
recommendation, or in certain circumstances investment banking
sensitivities, are appropriate for this designation. (Emphasis in the original.)
12
F. The Firm Provided Certain Companies With an Informal ""Warranty"" of Research
13
Coverage in Conjunction With Investment Banking Transactions
14
1.
The Firm typically initiated research coverage on companies that engaged the
Firm in an IB transaction.
15
2.
H&Q and Chase H&Q had an informal policy of providing certain companies with a
16
""warranty"" of research coverage in conjunction with IB transactions.
17
3.
For example, in an e-mail dated November 22, 2000, and sent by the Head of
eBusiness at Chase H&Q to the Head of Research at Chase H&Q and others, the
18
Head of eBusiness stated the following: ""I think that it is important to guaranty [sic]
some level of consistent coverage for our fee paying IB clients. In terms of a
19
'warranty period, I think that a period of 18 months would be a fair and appropriate
coverage period, as well as a reasonable timeframe for a company to show
20
progress and perhaps 'earn' an extension of coverage. During this transition
period we could offer more of a general, maintenance-only, 'no name' research
21
coverage [that] could be done by a ""team' of junior associates from both the IB
and research side of the house as part of the 'pod' approach to a sector. This
22
coverage would allow the pod to continue to maintain a relationship with the
company, generating additional income from the account.""
23
4.
The Firm verbally promoted this warranty research coverage in conjunction with
24
pitches of IB business to companies, and research coverage would be maintained
on certain companies subject to the warranty.
25
1
5.
For example, in an e-mail dated October 20, 1999, an investment banker sent an
e-mail to senior executives at H&Q that contained the following subject line:
2
""Follow Up on a Pitch Please."" The e-mail stated: [Head of IB:] Please call [the
Chairman of CCC Info. Services Script: You know that [a team of investment
3
bankers] presented to the board yesterday and that we are very excited about the
prospect of serving as agent for a private round with financial and strategic parties
4
and as lead manager on their IPO in early 00 Our pitch is 4. Best aftermarket
'warranty.""
5
6.
Also, in an e-mail dated December 19, 2000, from an investment banker to a
6
member of the board of directors of Epicor Software Corporation (""Epicor""), the
banker stated: ""Just a heads up that the extended warranty provided for Epicor is
7
running out."" In an e-mail dated December 22, ,2000, the board member replied:
""not a surprise. thanks for sticking to the deal.""
8
G. The Firm's Pitch Materials Contained Discussions of Research Coverage
9
1.
During the relevant period, companies considered research coverage to be an
10
important factor in selecting a firm for an underwriting transaction.
11
2.
In certain pitch materials, the Research Department, and research analysts in
12
particular, were described to implicitly suggest that the Firm would provide
favorable research coverage after the IB transaction.³ The research analyst's
13
reputation and industry ranking, statistics regarding the percentage of lead- and
co-managed IPOs currently under coverage, and the Firm's ""aftermarket support'
14
were promoted in pitch materials. In addition, the Firm utilized ""case studies"" of
companies under coverage that included charts comparing the dates of positive
15
published research to the company's stock price. The case studies showed the
stock price increases following the analyst's positive recommendation and/or
16
placement on the analyst's or the Firm's ""Focus Lists.""
17
3.
For example, in an e-mail dated February 23, 2000, an investment banker
forwarded pitch materials to an employee of Participate.com to persuade the
18
company to employ the Firm as an underwriter for an upcoming IPO and private
offering. The pitch materials identified the research analyst who would cover the
19
company after the IB transaction. In pages captioned ""[Research analyst's name]
Authoritative Voice in the Marketplace,"" ""case studies"" were presented on the
20
analyst's past coverage of two companies: Wireless Facilities and AppNet.
21
4.
The case studies contained charts that showed the stock price increases following
placement of the stocks on the analyst's and Firm's focus lists. The ""Wireless
22
Facilities Case Study"" stated the following: ""Chase H&Q adds WFI to Focus List:
WFI gains 11.7% (1/27/00)."" The ""AppNet Case Study stated the following:
23
""Chase H&Q adds AppNet to Focus List: AppNet gains 7.5% (8/2/99). While on
[the research analyst's] Focus List, AppNet appreciates 309% (8/2/99-10/26/99).
24
25
3 Pitch materials"" are the written materials provided to the management of an issuer in conjunction with the
Firm's pitch or presentation of its strengths and capabilities in conducting an upcoming IPO or other IB
transaction.
1
5.
Also presented were excerpts of positive commentary by the research analyst that
2
accompanied the Buy ratings and/or placement on the focus lists.
3
H. Research Analysts Were Visible on Stocks to Generate Investment Banking
4
Business
5
1.
Research analysts were encouraged to increase their visibility, or level of
communication, on certain stocks to generate IB business.
6
2.
Lists of stocks were distributed to various departments at the Firm, including the
7
Research Department.
8
3.
The ""ECM [Equity Capital Markets] target list"" contained stocks of companies from
which the Firm was seeking IB business during the next eighteen (18) months.
9
4.
The ""trading focus list"" contained stocks of companies from which the Firm was
10
seeking IB or underwriting business during the next three months.
11
5.
The Research Department and other departments were at times encouraged to
12
increase the trading volume of the stocks on the lists for IB purposes.
13
6.
The following e-mail, dated May 11, 2001, and sent from an investment banker to
individuals on the ""IB Ebusiness"" distribution list, explains the rationale for the two
14
lists: ""The criteria for being on the [ECM target] list is potential equity business
over the next 18 months where we would like to target the resources of the firm to
15
win the books Our objective is to make sure we are being as proactive as
possible from an equity perspective, and focusing the equity resources of the firm
16
on these targets to help you win the books for these transactions The criteria for
being placed on the trading focus list is an investment banking event with [sic] the
17
NEXT THREE MONTHS This investment banking list could be an m&a event or
an equity event In cases where the investment banking event will occur far in
18
advance, our first approach is to work with the traders, analysts and sales traders
to increase our trading activity naturally, before we start spending the firm's
19
capital."" (Emphasis in the original.)
20
7.
Trading rank was important to a company's choice of a firm for IB transactions,
and the Firm's trading rank was often promoted in pitch materials provided to
21
potential IB clients.
22
8.
For example, pitch materials provided in conjunction with the AppNet IPO
contained a section entitled, ""Commitment to Corporate Clients Delivers
23
Institutional Credibility and Trading Strength."" There, H&Q's Autex trading rank is
identified as ""#1,' ""#2,"" ""#3,"" and ""#4"" in the stocks of specific companies that
24
engaged H&Q for an IPO.
25
9.
Certain research analysts were encouraged to increase their visibility, or level of
communication, on stocks contained in the lists.
1
10. For example, in an e-mail dated September 27, 2000, from an investment banker.
to a research analyst and others, the banker forwarded September's focus list and
2
stated: ""The list is okay but we are falling way short on a few names. Vicinity we
are not AT [sic] the goal, we are below the goal for the past two months. This is a
3
problem. On Intertrust and Mypoints, we are not even close to our targets. Less
critical, but we need to do a better job. Concord EFS paid us $5 MM last year and
4
we are the #18 trader of that stock. Also disappointing [Y]ou [research analyst]
need to get more visible on these names with the salespeople so that trading
5
doesn't have that excuse to hide behind.'
6
I. Payments for Research
7
1.
During the relevant period, H&Q and Chase H&Q made seven payments totaling
$1,312,500 for research issued in conjunction with five underwriting transactions in
8
which the Firm was a lead- or co-manager.
9
2.
H&Q and Chase H&Q made these payments for research without disclosing or
10
ensuring their disclosure in offering documents or elsewhere,
11
J. The Firm Failed to Adequately Supervise Its Research and Investment Banking
Departments
12
1.
While the role of research analysts was to produce objective research, the Firm
13
also encouraged them to participate in IB activities.
14
2.
In addition, the Research and IB Departments had a formal connection within the
Firm's organizational structure. From February to December 2000 at
15
RESPONDENT JPMSI, the Head of Research had a dual reporting line to both the
Head of Equities and the Head of Investment Banking.
16
3.
Also, in 2000 at Chase H&Q, research analysts were organized and placed into
17
""Analyst Sub-pods"" for purposes of managing and monitoring their IB activities.
Research analysts reported to ""Sub-pod Managers,"" who were investment bankers
18
and were responsible for the day-to-day coordination of the research analysts' IB
activities.
19
4.
The Analyst Sub-pod system for Chase H&Q ""Internet Research and Banking"" is
20
explained in a May 2000 Chase H&Q interoffice memorandum which contained a
""coordination chart."" In the chart, the Analyst Sub-pods had a direct reporting line
21
to the Sub-pod Managers. The memorandum stated the following: ""The 'Analyst
Sub-pod' is the organizational engine for all that we do."" Sub-pod Managers, who
22
were investment bankers, were responsible for the ""pipeline management
and the day-to-day coordination of the particular analyst as it relates to
23
investment banking activity The Sub-pod Manager is not responsible for
executing all of that particular analyst's transactions, but is responsible for
24
ensuring that appropriate resources are allocated. As such, the Sub-pod Manager
should expect to spend a majority of his time banking the Sub-pod Analyst with the
25
balance of his time spent banking other analysts as the demands of the business
require it."" (Emphasis in the original.)
1
5.
The Analyst Sub-pod system was created to provide ""enhanced coordination
between Banking and Research.""
2
6.
As a result of the foregoing, research analysts were subject to IB influences and
3
conflicts of interest between supporting the Firm's IB business and publishing
objective research. The Firm had knowledge of these IB influences and conflicts
4
of interest yet failed to manage them adequately to protect the objectivity of
published research.
5
7.
The Firm failed to establish and maintain adequate policies, systems, and
6
procedures reasonably designed to ensure the objectivity of its published
research. Although the Firm had some policies governing research analysts'
7
activities during the relevant period, these policies were inadequate and did not
address the IB influences and conflicts of interest that existed.
8
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
9
10
1. The Division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to The Alaska Securities Act.
11
2. The Division finds that Respondent JPMSI failed to establish and enforce written
supervisory procedures reasonably designed to ensure that analysts were not unduly
12
influenced by investment banking concerns in violation of AS 45.55.060(a)(7) and (b)(1).
13
3. The Division finds that Respondent JPMSI engaged in acts and practices that
created or maintained inappropriate influence by the IB Department over research analysts,
14
therefore imposing conflicts of interest on its research analysts, and failing to manage these
conflicts in an adequate or appropriate manner, constituted violations of AS 45.55.060(a)(7)
15
and (b)(1).
16
4. The Division finds that Respondent JPMSI made payments for research to other
broker-dealers not involved in an underwriting transaction when the Firm knew that these
17
payments were made, at least in part, for research coverage, and by failing to disclose or
cause to be disclosed in offering documents or elsewhere the fact of such payments
18
constituted a violation of AS 45.55.060(a)(7) and (b)(1).
19
5. The Division finds the following relief appropriate and in the public interest.
20

Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by the Alaska
3

II.
FINDINGS OF FACT
4
A.
Background and Jurisdiction
1.
Bear Stearns, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in
5
New York, New York, is a subsidiary of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc.
Bear Stearns provides equity research, sales, and trading services; merger
6
and acquisition advisory services; venture capital services; and underwriting
services on a global basis.
7
2.
(""Commission""), Bear registered Stock Exchange, Inc.
Stearns is with the Securities and Exchange Commission
is a member of the New York
8
(""Exchange"") and the NASD Inc. (""NASD"") and is licensed to conduct
securities business on a nationwide basis.
9
3.
Bear Stearns is currently registered with the division as a broker-dealer, and
has been so registered since 1979.
10
4.
This action concerns the time period of July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2001 (the
relevant period). During that time, Bear Stearns engaged in both research
11
and investment banking (IB) activities.
B.
Overview
12
1.
During the relevant period, the Firm sought and did IB business with many
13
companies covered by its research. Research analysts were encouraged to
participate in IB activities, and that was a factor considered in the analysts'
14
compensation system. In addition, the decision to initiate and maintain
research coverage of certain companies was in some cases coordinated with
15
the IB Department and influenced by IB interests.
2.
As a result of the foregoing, certain research analysts at the Firm were
16
subjected to IB influences and conflicts of interest between supporting the IB
business at the Firm and publishing objective research.
17
3.
The Firm had knowledge of these IB influences and conflicts of interest yet
failed to establish and maintain adequate policies, systems and procedures
18
that were reasonably designed to detect and prevent the influences and
manage the conflicts.
19
c.
Research Analyst Participation in Investment Banking Activities
1.
Research analysts were responsible for providing analyses of the financial
20
outlook of particular companies in the context of the business sectors in which
those companies operated and the securities market as a whole.
21
2.
Research analysts evaluated companies by, among other things, examining
financial information contained in public filings, questioning company
22
management, investigating customer and supplier relationships, evaluating
companies' business plans and the products or services offered, building
23
financial models and analyzing competitive trends.
3.
After synthesizing and analyzing this information, analysts produced research
24
in the form of full reports and more abbreviated formats that typically
contained a recommendation, a price target, and a summary and analysis of
25
the factors relied upon by the analyst.
1
4.
The Firm distributed its analysts' research internally to various departments at
the Firm and externally to the Firm's retail and institutional investing clients.
2
In addition, the Firm sold some of its research directly to non-clients,
disseminated it through distribution agreements with other broker dealers,
3
made it available to third party subscription services such as First Call, and
offered it for sale via market websites such as MultexInvestor.
4
5.
In addition to performing research functions, certain research analysts
participated or assisted in IB activities. These IB activities included identifying
5
companies as prospects for IB services, participating in ""pitches"" of IB
services to companies, attending ""road shows"" associated with underwriting
6
transactions, and speaking to investors to generate interest in underwriting
transactions.
7
6.
In preparation for each ""pitch,"" the bankers, with the analyst's input, prepared
a ""pitch book"" which was distributed at the meeting and contained a summary
8
of the Firm's presentation.
7.
The pitch books, in some instances, identified the covering analyst by name,
9
provided information about that analyst's background and reputation,
sometimes characterizing the analyst as the ""ax"" in his or her coverage
10
sector, and highlighted the success of Bear Stearns' underwritten IPÓs
covered by the analyst. The pitch books also highlighted such factors as the
11
number of lead and co-managed IPOs that the Firm currently had under
research coverage. This information was intended to convey to the issuer
12
that such treatment would be accorded to it if Bear Stearns received the
mandate for the IB transaction.
13
8.
The analyst's reputation played a role in pitching the Firm's IB services to
14
potential clients. Issuers often chose an investment bank because of the
reputation of the analyst that would cover the company's stock.
15
9.
The pitch to an issuer by the research analyst contributed to Bear Stearns'
ability to win investment banking deals and receive investment banking fees
16
from that and subsequent investment banking relationships.
10.
The investment banking division at Bear Stearns advised corporate clients
17
and helped them execute various financial transactions, including the
issuance of stock and other securities. Bear Stearns frequently served as the
18
lead or as a co-lead underwriter in initial public offerings (""IPOs"") -- the first
public issuance of stock of a company that has not previously been publicly
19
traded -- and follow-on offering of securities.
11.
During the relevant period, investment banking was an important source of
20
revenues and profits for Bear Stearns. In 2000, investment banking
generated more than $965 million in net revenues, or approximately eighteen
21
22
A ""pitch"" is a presentation made by bankers and research analysts to a potential IB client in order to obtain the
mandate for an upcoming IB transaction. In competing for an IB mandate, the Firm typically sent bankers and the
23
analyst to meet with company management to persuade the company to select the Firm as one of the investment
bankers in a contemplated transaction. At these ""pitch"" meetings Flrm bankers would present their level of expertise
24
in the company's sector and discuss their previous experience with other such companies, as well as their view of the
company's merits and likelihood of success.
25
2
A ""road show"" is a series of presentations made to potential Investors in conjunction with the marketing of an
upcoming underwriting.
1
percent of Bear Stearns' total net revenues.
12.
The IB activities in which analysts participated also included participating in
2
commitment committee³ and due diligence activities in connection with
underwriting transactions and from time to time assisting the IB Department in
3
providing merger and acquisition (""M&A"") and other advisory services to
companies.
4
13.
The Firm encouraged research analysts to support the IB and other
businesses of the Firm. With regard to IB, research analysts were
5
encouraged to work in partnership with the IB Department by participating in
the foregoing IB activities, and the level of certain research analysts'
6
participation in these IB activities was sometimes significant.
a.
On 1999, the Head of Research provided research
7
analysts guidelines September guidelines 23, they [the business research plans.
with to follow in drafting their The
stated were ""designed to help analysts]
8
focus on executing and delivering [their] goals, improving [their] overall
contribution to the firm and enhancing [their] relationships with [their]
9
partners throughout the firm."" These guidelines requested the
research analysts to describe their contributions to nine separate areas
10
of the Firm's business. With respect to the area identified as
""Banking,"" the guidelines stated: ""After your business plan meeting
11
with your bankers please discuss any ideas you have generated for
deal origination and timing of coverage for existing or proposed
12
corporate relationships. Include or attach to your business plan
a list
of stocks you and your corporate finance team have agreed upon as
13
priorities. Include plans to help market transactions or to introduce
14
M&A activity. Discuss any plans to drop coverage where there is no
longer a strategic fit.""
15
b.
In her 1997/1998 business plan, an analyst stated, ""If I were any more
aggressive in the banking area, my office would be on the third floor
16
[location of IB offices of the Firm].""
14.
In connection with their participation in IB. activities, certain research analysts
17
and investment bankers (bankers) communicated, in various frequency and
extent, through meetings and via telephone and electronic mail (e-mail).
18
15.
The IB department at the Firm was organized into industry groups that
corresponded to certain research sectors. Research analysts were aware
19
that, in certain circumstances, their positive and continued coverage of
particular companies was an important factor for the generation of investment
banking business. Thus, some research analysts and bankers coordinated
Deleted: investment
20
the initiation and maintenance of research coverage, based upon, among
21
other things, investment banking considerations.
a.
On February 9, 2000, two bankers and an analyst submitted a joint
22
business plan to the co-heads of the IB technology group. The stated
purpose of the memorandum was to ""describe a strategy for
23
investment banking and research coverage and coordination of
companies which provide Internet enabling technologies. The near-
24
25
3
The ""commitment committee' was responsible for, among other things, evaluating and determining the Firm's
participation in IPOs and other IB transactions.
1
term goal is to establish an organized and prioritized calling effort with
an emphasis on cultivating fewer and deeper, lead managed
2
relationships."" [Emphasis in original.]
D.
Participation in Investment Banking Activities was a Factor in Evaluating and
3
Compensating Research Analysts
4
1.
The compensation system at the Firm provided an incentive for research
5
analysts to contribute to all areas of the Firm's business, including
participating several
in IB activities and assisting in generating IB business for the
6
Firm. Research analysts' participation in IB activities was one of
factors considered in determining their compensation. Notes of staff
7
meetings reflect the following statements by the Head of Research to
analysts:
8
a.
""I'd like to remind everyone how you get paid at Bear Stearns. It is
9
based on your contribution to your team and your contribution to the
firm
Notice that being a partner with banking is part of the analyst
10
job description. You are not compared or matrixed or in any way paid
on a formula. Working on transactions is not incremental to your
11
compensation, it is an expected part of it.'
12
b.
""I need to remind you that investment banking revenues are not
incremental to your bonus. Being a partner to banking is part of your
13
job. You are paid on performance and based on your contribution to
the firm.""
14
15
2.
The performance of research analysts was evaluated through an annual
review process. Where not set by contract, the research analyst's salary and
16
annual bonus were also determined through this process.
17
3.
Information on the analyst's job performance was gathered through annual
self-evaluations, analyst's business plans, surveys of management, and
18
trading and institutional sales department personnel, e-mail and oral feedback
from employees in the IB and other departments at the Firm, and the Firm's
19
institutional clients.
20
4.
The research analysts' annual business plans contained, among other things,
their contributions to various areas of the Firm, including IB, for the past year,
21
and their plans for improving their contribution to these areas of the Firm,
including IB, in the coming year.
22
5.
In their self-evaluations, which were used to communicate their
23
accomplishments to and petition management for increased compensation
analysts discussed such areas as their rankings in independent research
24
polls, the scope of their research coverage, their participation in industry
conferences, and the Firm's Autex rankings in stocks they covered. Certain
25
research analysts provided extensive information regarding their assistance
to IB, including accomplishments, goals, and participation in lead- and co-
1
managed underwritings, and sometimes also including the revenues to the
Firm associated with the IB transactions on which the analyst worked. In
2
addition, analysts were occasionally requested to inform research
management of fees generated by the IB transactions on which they worked.
3
a.
In an October 24, 2000 e-mail to the Head of Research, a senior
4
analyst summarized his 9 key accomplishments during fiscal year
2000. The first and largest point, which dealt with his contributions to
5
IB, stated as follows: ""*Corporate finance: generated over $23 million
in fees to the firm in nine separate transactions: *Storage networking:
6
identified a new financial opportunity for the firm, which resulted in six
transactions
I should be designated as a finder for Ancor [Ancor
7
Communications), JNI [JNI Corp.] and Vixel [Vixel Corp.]. *iAppliances:
identified a new industry category which was a source of two IPOs
8
*Agilent [Agilent Technologies]: 1 should be designated as a finder --
or at least a save for Agilent. BS pitched the business and lost. I went
9
in and re-won the business, generated fees of around $2.5 million to
the firm."" The e-mail to the Head of Research included a spreadsheet
10
listing the IB transactions on which he had worked and the associated
revenues to the Firm. The Head of Research praised the format of the
11
summary and suggested she might have all research analysts submit
theirs in the same form.
12
b.
in a June 21, 2001 e-mail from a member of the research management
13
staff, the research analysts were requested to submit information
regarding all banking transactions that had closed or that were pending
14
in their sectors during the prior 6 month period.
15
6.
Certain research analysts perceived that the amount of their bonus would be
16
influenced by their contribution to and impact on the firm's IB business, and
the fees generated by IB transactions on which they worked.
17
7.
Research analysts were encouraged to support and assist all areas of the
18
Firm and to participate in IB activities and activities that enhanced the
reputation of the Firm's IB business. Based upon statements by research
19
management indicating that partnership with banking was part of their job as
research analysts, the inclusion of a ""Banking"" section in their annual
20
business plans, information regarding IB transactions in their self-evaluations,
and requests from research management for specific information regarding IB
21
transactions in their coverage sectors, certain research analysts believed that
the revenues generated by their participation in IB activities was an important
22
factor in their evaluations and compensation. Accordingly, some research
analysts were encouraged to participate in IB activities, increase IB revenues,
23
and enhance the reputation of the Firm, including its IB business.
24
8.
Research Analysts' salaries and bonuses were determined by a multiple
factor-based approach. Among other things, analysts were judged for
25
compensation purposes based on the performance of their stock picks, their
impact on the buy-side accounts as measured by votes, the Firm's market
1
share in trading volume in the stocks they covered, their participation in IB
activities, and the fees and secondary trading commissions generated from
2
those activities were considered.
3
E.
Investment Banking Interests Influenced the Firm's Decisions to Initiate and
4
Maintain Research Coverage
5
1.
In general, the Firm determined whether to initiate and maintain research
6
coverage based upon institutional investors' interest in the company, and the
company's importance to the sector or IB considerations, such as attracting
7
companies to the Firm to generate IB business or maintaining a positive
relationship with existing IB clients.
8
2.
The nature and duration of research coverage were important criteria for a
9
company's choice of a broker dealer for IB services. The pitch books typically
contained information stating, among other things, that: ""an important
10
element to successfully executing an IPO is having an assurance that the
11
Firm will provide research coverage to the IPO candidate in the offering and
in the aftermarket.""
12
3.
The Firm generally initiated coverage on companies that engaged the Firm in
13
an IB transaction. In pitching for IB business, the Firm sometimes
represented to the company the frequency with which reports would be
14
issued.
15
4.
The Firm's ratings system, which was intended to reflect the long-term
prospects of a rated stock, allowed research analysts to assign one of five
16
ratings to a stock: (1) ""Buy"" - Expected to outperform the local market by
20% in the next 12 months. Strong conviction and typically accompanied by
17
an identifiable catalyst; (2) ""Attractive"" - Expected to outperform the local
market by 10% or more, it is usually more difficult to identify the catalyst; (3)
18
""Neutral"" - Expected to perform in line with the local market; (4) ""Unattractive""
- Expected to underperform the local market; and (5) ""Sell"" - Avoid the stock.
19
5.
During the relevant period, there was a sharp downturn in the stock market
20
and stocks in certain sectors performed poorly. During this period, the Firm
did not issue ratings of ""Unattractive"" or ""Sell"" in connection with any covered
21
companies in these sectors.
22
6.
Research management communicated with IB management to ensure that
research opportunities were appropriately aligned with identified IB
23
opportunities.
24
7.
The Stock Selection Committee was ultimately responsible for making the
determination to initiate coverage of a given company. The Head of
25
Research was ultimately responsible for making the determination to maintain
research coverage. Nonetheless, IB considerations sometimes influenced
1
the decision to initiate and maintain coverage.
2
8.
Some research analysts and bankers actively coordinated the initiation and
maintenance of research coverage based upon, among other things, IB
3
considerations. This coordination consisted of meetings and communications
by telephone and e-mail.
4
9.
In some circumstances, research coverage was initiated based on IB
5
considerations.
6
a.
In an April 19, 2000 e-mail from a member of his staff, the head of the
IB Technology Group communicated the following to the Heads of
7
Research and IB as well as numerous analysts and bankers: ""[Analyst
A] and [Analyst B] agree that [Analyst B] will be the analyst covering
8
CacheFlo [Cacheflow]. [Banker] and [Analyst B] will discuss with
CacheFlo what the planned timing of their offering will be so as to
9
insure that if we initiate coverage in advance of the transaction we will
not be prohibited from being an underwriter. [Analyst B] and [Banker]
10
will also stress to the company that if we initiate coverage we expect
our position in the company's future financing and strategy actions to
11
be materially improved.""
12
13
10.
Given that research analysts participated in determining In which IB
transactions in their sectors the Firm would participate, if the Firm determined
14
to participate in an equity offering for a company, it was expected the
company would qualify for an initial ""Buy"" rating.
15
11.
An analyst who anticipated initiating coverage of such a company with less
16
than a ""Buy"" rating informed IB in advance as follows.
17
a.
In a February 8, 2000 e-mail to bankers and the Head of Research,
this analyst stated: ""Just wanted to be sure that everyone knows that
18
we will be using an Attractive rating on go.com. If anyone has any
comments or issues, please let me know.""
19
b.
In a March 17, 2000 e-mail to research analysts, an associate analyst
Deleted: 1ì
20
stated: ""I talked to [the liaison between research and IB] and we have
,
1
the go ahead to initiate on IPET [Pets.com] with an Attractive rating.
1
21
According to [the liaison] we should explain somewhere in the text,
1
why our opinion about the company's prospects have changed from
22
the time we initiated coverage.""
23
c.
In his annual evaluation, this analyst was criticized as follows: ""Has
been working poorly w/bankers - in changing opinions after the firm
24
has committed to co. mgmts"". The analyst testified that he believed
25
4
In fact, Bear Stearns had not yet initiated coverage on IPET at the time this e-mail was sent.
1
the statement related to his communicating his opinions regarding
companies to bankers in a timely manner, and that if his opinior
2
regarding a company changed from a more positive opinion to a more
negative opinion about a company after a banker had already made
3
some sort of commitment to a company, it made life difficult for the
banker and was not ideal from his standpoint. He went on to testify
4
that, particularly in his highly volatile sector, companies often changed
a lot between the time of the first organizational meeting and the date
5
of the IPO.
6
12.
In some circumstances, the determination to maintain research was
influenced by IB considerations.
7
a.
Due to IB influences a supervisory analyst perceived and
8
communicated to others that IB approval was required before coverage
could be dropped. In response to an inquiry by an associate analyst
9
regarding dropping coverage of 2 companies, a supervisory analyst
stated in an April 19, 2002 e-mail: ""[The Head of Research] says
10
before dropping coverage, you need to get permission from both: 1.
the market makers on the trading desk, 2. the bankers.""
11
b.
In an April 3, 2000 e-mail to the Heads of Research and IB as well às
12
numerous members of both departments, a banker discussed a
company's decision to exclude the Firm from a follow-on offering. He
13
stated: ""I expressed significant disappointment with the fact that they
14
neglected to discuss this issue with us prior to this time and that they
left us no choice but to drop research coverage and trading, since they
15
obviously did not value our support to date. [Analyst] - As we
discussed, feel free to drop at any time. I told the CFO that you would
16
likely put out a note, but did not know when."" In a follow-up e-mail the
Head of Research stated that she agreed with the decision to drop
17
coverage. The analyst ultimately determined not to drop coverage.
18
1.
Issuers also considered investment banks' aftermarket trading support as a
19
factor in selecting an investment bank. The Firm's trading volume and trading
rank were factors it promoted to IB clients in pitch presentations.
20
F
2.
The Firm distributed to sales and trading personnel and research analysts the
21
""Trading Focus List,"" which contained stocks of companies from which the
Firm was seeking or with which the Firm had IB business.
22
3.
A research analyst actively marketed companies on the Trading Focus List in
23
order to obtain IB business.
24
a.
In a December 10, 1999 e-mail, an analyst wrote the following to
Equity Trading copied to the Heads of Research and IB: ""Subject: Pis
25
make the trading of Packeteer a top priority. 1 spent two days with
Packeteer ('PKTR') management this week visiting investors.
1
Management are extremely happy with our research coverage and
banking services. But they have repeatedly indicated to me that our
2
trading stat. is not satisfactory. CEO hinted to me many times that
we
have a chance for the books for the secondary if we improve the
3
trading.. They are likely to do a secondary in Q1 - mostly likely late
January/early February; could be as much as $200 MM deal. Please
4
help us in improving our trading immediately. We will do whatever it
takes from the research side.""
5
b.
In a September 14, 2000 e-mail to Equity Trading the same analyst
6
wrote the following regarding banking client SonicWall (""SNWL""): ""We
need help in boosting our trading stat for SNWL. Both management
7
and their VC called me yesterday complaining about our trading - #2 in
August and #3 so far in September. More importantly, they argued that
8
we are not supporting the stock when it is weak I made a positive
call
on Monday but am not getting much support. Pls help us here since
9
this important technology client indicated to me that if we do not
improve, it will hurt our banking relationship with the company,""
10
c.
In a March 8, 2001 e-mail the same analyst again wrote to Equity
11
Trading regarding two IB clients he covered: ""Subject: MUSE
[Micromuse] and ISSX [Internet Security Systems] autex - both on
12
focus list. On MUSE - we dropped from #3 or 4 in 2000 to #10 in Feb
13
and March to date. I just called the trader to see what we can do. I
have been extremely active on the name- took management to Boston,
14
Denver, Minneapolis and KC in February alone. Do not quite
understand. Pls follow up. ISSX - we dropped from #2 or #3. to #11 in
15
March. I am very active on ISSX also. Thanks for your help on this.""
Equity Trading responded: ""What do you want me to do? Get some
16
orders on the stock yourself. Generate some order flowll"" The analyst
replied: ""I am trying. but are the traders on these two stocks good?""
17
7. In order to raise or maintain the Firm's visibility on stocks with which the Firm
18
wanted to do IB business, certain research analysts nominated companies to
participate at Firm sponsored conferences, took company managements on
19
non-deal road shows, hosted field trips for institutional investors to
companies' headquarters and arranged other meetings between institutional
20
investor clients and companies.
21
8.
Research analysts were visible on stocks of companies with which the Firm
wanted to do IB business in order to generate IB business.
22
23
1.
Certain research analysts communicated regularly with employees of the
companies that they covered, including executive and senior management of
24
those companies. These communications occurred through telephone and e-
mail exchanges, company-sponsored events, and analyst calls.
25
1
2.
Research analysts were sometimes subject to pressure from companies they
covered to issue better ratings and recommendations. Research analysts
2
understood that negative ratings and recommendations could adversely affect
the Firm's ability to attract and retain IB business from those companies.
3
a.
On November 2, 2000, in his 2000 self-evaluation an analyst wrote in a
4
section entitled ""Areas to Improve: We want our banking clients to
know that our research is objective and independent but always
5
sensitive to their best interests. There have been instances in my
career where certain banking clients felt that our research and public
6
comments weren't sensitive to their interests. This is a very important
issue for us and we take it most seriously. We will continue to make
7
every effort to be sensitive to our clients and our banking partners.""
8
3.
When research analysts downgraded or issued a negative comment on a
banking client, they sometimes received direct feedback from high-ranking
9
company officials.
10
a. In an August 24, 2000 e-mail, a banking client responding to a downgrade
of his company wrote: ""Your earnings estimates are on track, however,
11
given the downgrade, I sure would have liked to see you give us a lower
bar
on revenue [W]hile we affirmed the revenue estimate, they were
12
definitely a stretch. Seems a shame to waste a downgrade by not buying
13
the opportunity for us both to over-perform going forward. ""
14
In Certain Instances the Firm Published Exaggerated or Unwarranted
Research
15
1.
On several occasions, the conflicts of interest discussed above resulted in
16
analysts publishing recommendations and/or ratings that were exaggerated or
unwarranted, and/or contained opinions for which there was no reasonable
17
basis. The following are examples of how these conflicts affected the
research.
18
a.
Bear Stearns lead managed the IPO and secondary offerings for
19
SonicWall in November 1999 and March 2000 respectively. An analyst
rated the stock a ""Buy"" from the IPO until April 2002. in January 25,
20
2001 while they were participating in a SonicWall conference call the
analyst stated to his associate: ""I am trying to make them look
21
good. on the dso and the growth etc."" A few minutes later he added:
""we got paid for this and I am going to Cancun tomorrow b/c of them!""
22
b.
Bear Stearns initiated coverage of MUSE with an ""Attractive"" rating in
23
September 1999, raised the rating to a ""Buy"" in January 2000 and
maintained a ""Buy"" rating on the stock until July 2002. While listening
24
to a MUSE analyst call on July 18, 2001, an analyst suggested to his
associate that he was going to downgrade his rating on the stock to
25
""Attractive"". The associate disagreed with the suggestion and the
analyst responded that the stock was ""dead money!"" However, the
1
analyst did not downgrade his rating on the stock, instead issuing
research the same day maintaining his ""Buy"" rating.
2
c.
Bear Stearns lead managed the IPO for CAIS Internet, Inc. in May
3
1999. The analyst rated the stock a ""Buy"" from the IPO through his
last report on the company in November 2000. On January 24, 2001,
4
in response to an e-mail reporting extensive service failures at CAIS
the analyst stated: ""Any other scoop on this piece of shit?"" A few days
5
later, in response to an institutional client's request for his thoughts on
CAIS' 4th quarter, the analyst stated: ""It's up a lot year to date don't
6
overstay your welcome on this one.""
7
d.
Bear Stearns co-managed the IPO and secondary offerings for Digital
River in August and December 1998 respectively. The Firm, via three
8
successive analysts, rated the stock a ""Buy"" from the IPO until April
2002. In an April 1, 2002 e-mail to his IB counterpart an analyst
9
stated: ""I have to tell you, I feel a bit compromised today. I have told
every client on the phone that they should avoid or short the stock over
10
the last few months. I have been fairly hands-off on DRIV [Digital
River, a stock under his coverage], primarily because of the banking
11
prospect that you and [Another Banker] have noted. Today, clearly the
stock is down a lot. The artificial Buy rating on the stock, while
12
artificial, still makes me look bad. In the future, l'd like to have more
leeway with the ratings, even for companies like Digital River, where
13
we have a relationship on the banking side. I trust it would benefit all
of us.'
14
15
I.
The Firm Made A Payment for Research
16
17
1.
In August 2000, as part of an offering that took place in May 2000, the Firm
made a payment of $102,750 to another broker-dealer in connection with
18
research coverage it provided for Andrx Corp. (""ADRX""), a Bear Stearns'
investment banking client in connection with an underwriting transaction for
19
which Bear Stearns was a lead manager.
20
2.
Bear Stearns did not take steps to ensure that this broker-dealer disclosed in
its research that it had been paid to issue research on ADRX. Further Bear
21
Stearns did not disclose or cause to be disclosed the details of this payment.
22
J.
Bear Stearns Failed to Adequately Supervise Its Research and Investment
23
Banking Departments
24
1.
While the role of the research analysts was to produce objective research, the
25
Firm also encouraged them to participate in IB activities. As a result of the
foregoing, research analysts were subject to IB influences and conflicts of
1
interest between supporting the IB business at the Firm and publishing
objective research.
2
2.
The Firm had knowledge of these IB influences and conflicts of interest yet
3
failed to manage them adequately to protect the objectivity of its published
research.
4
3.
Bear Stearns failed to establish and maintain adequate policies, systems and
5
procedures reasonably designed to ensure the objectivity of its published
research. Although Bear Stearns had some policies governing research
6
analyst activities during the relevant period, these policies were inadequate
and did not address the conflicts of interest that existed.

TITLE
CASE NO. 04-06 S
1
I.
2
FINDINGS OF FACT
3
A.
Background and Jurisdiction
4
1.
USBPJ is a broker-dealer with its principal place of business in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
5
The firm engages in a full-service securities business, including retail and institutional
sales, investment banking services, trading, and research.
6
2.
USBPJ is currently registered with the division as a broker-dealer, and has been so
7
registered since 1972.
8
3.
This action concerns the years 1999, 2000, and 2001 (the ""relevant period""). During that
9
time, USBPJ engaged in both research and investment banking (""IB"") activities.
10
4.
At various times during the relevant period, USBPJ placed undue emphasis on using its
research analysts to maximize opportunities to obtain nvestment-banking revenues from
11
companies in the technology, telecommunications, and biotechnology industry sectors.
Such emphasis on obtaining investment-banking revenue created conflicts of interest for
12
the research analysts that resulted in the issuance of research reports that violated the Act.
13
USBPJ failed adequately to monitor and supervise the conflicts of interest inherent in
seeking investment-banking opportunities from companies covered by USBPJ research
14
analysts. USBPJ's violative conduct, described herein, was caused by a flawed
organizational structure, combined with inadequate supervision of the conflicts of
15
interest.
16
5.
USBPJ grouped its research analysts by industry sector and those analysts worked as a
17
team with the firm's investment bankers, who focused on the same industry sector. The
majority of research analysts' compensation was paid in the form of bonuses, which for
18
some analysts was directly tied to revenues from investment banking transactions of
companies in their industry sector. In other cases, the analyst's contribution to
19
investment banking revenue, and investment banker input into analysts' evaluations
played a significant part in determining the analysts' bonuses. In certain cases,
20
investment bankers commented in reviews that research analysts needed to become lead
21
analysts, a reference to using their professional opinions and reports to assist the firm in
obtaining the top role in investment banking transactions. As a result of these influences,
22
certain USBPJ research analysts indirectly were motivated to obtain, retain and increase
investment-banking revenue.
23
6.
In
certain instances, USBPJ also provided draft research reports to potential investment
24
banking clients during sales pitches, and this implicit promise of favorable research was
25
an important aspect of USBPJ's attempts to gain the companies' investment banking
business. In other instances, after determining to issue research, USBPJ provided
26
company executives with draft reports, including the proposed rating and target price, and
solicited comments on the report from those company executives.
27
7.
32
USBPJ failed to disclose that it received compensation from the proceeds of underwriting
28
for, among other services, providing research. It also paid proceeds of certain
2
TITLE
011.1152214.1
CASE NO. 04-06 S
1
underwritings to other broker dealer firms to issue research on companies whose
offerings it underwrote and did not ensure that such payments were disclosed.
2
8.
Finally, USBPJ engaged in improper behavior by threatening to drop research coverage
3
on a company if USBPJ did not receive a certain role in the company's offering of
securities.
4
5
B.
USBPJ's Structure and Procedures Encouraged Research Analysts to Contribute to
Investment Banking Revenue, Thus Creating Conflicts of Interest
6
(1)
Overview of USBPJ and the Financial Contribution of its Equity Capital
7
Markets Division
8
9.
USBPJ was founded in 1895. The firm is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and
I
has approximately 3, ,100 employees, including approximately 875 financial advisers,
9
more than 80 investment bankers, and approximately 70 research analysts. USBPJ has
10
operations in 124 offices in 25 states throughout the country.
11
10.
During the relevant period, USBPJ's business included retail brokerage, known as Private
Advisory Services; fixed income underwriting, sales and trading (known as Fixed Income
12
Capital Markets); and equities investment banking, syndicate, research, and institutional
sales and trading (known as Equity Capital Markets or ""ECM""). Thus, equity research
13
and investment banking were in the same business line and, ultimately, reported to the
14
same individual.
15
11.
In 1998, USBPJ generated equity investment banking revenue of approximately
$79,500,000. That increased by 100 percent to approximately $159,000,000 in 1999. In
16
2000, revenue from equity investment banking grew to approximately $269,200,000, a 69
percent increase over 1999. In 2001, USBPJ's revenue from equity investment banking
17
was approximately $153,000,000. From 1999 through 2001, revenue from equity
18
investment banking represented a significant portion of the firm's revenue, accounting for
between 19-26 percent of the firm's total revenue.
19
(2)
USBPJ Aligned Research Analysts With the Firm's Investment Bankers
20
(a)
USBPJ Developed and Implemented Specific Plans To Have Research
21
Analysts Work With Investment Bankers in an Effort to Obtain
Investment Banking Business
22
12.
23
During the relevant period, many companies, particularly those in the technology area,
issued stock through public offerings, and there was intense competition among
24
investment banking firms to obtain this business. In order to maximize its chances to
participate in these offerings, USBPJ made a concerted effort to include its research
25
analysts in its solicitation of this business. This effort included developing and
implementing specific marketing plans, which provided for research analyst involvement
26
in the investment banking process.
27

28
U.S. Bancorp acquired USBPJ Inc., as a subsidiary in 1998.

TITLE
011.1152214.1
CASE NO. 04-06 S
1
(i)
Move to the Left Strategy
2
13.
In May 2000, USBPJ's ECM Operating Committee amended its procedures and
strategies in a specific effort to gain lead manager status in more offerings. The Lead
3
Manager is the firm typically listed on the left side of the offering prospectus. Thus,
USBPJ implemented a plan referred to as the ""Move to the Left Strategy.'' The ECM
4
Operating Committee noted its strong commitment to a ""multi-pronged strategy"" to
5
obtain lead-manager status on offerings. In instructions to ECM employees, the ECM
Operating Committee stated that the firm ""must begin to wage a war in earnest for lead-
6
manager status.' That plan instituted a ""line in the sand"" policy: The firm would not
accept a syndicate position in any deal unless the firm was placed in the major bracket for
7
the underwriting.
8
14.
The Research Department played an important role in the firm's Move to the Left
9
Strategy. Specifically, to develop a ""lead manager mentality,"" the firm developed a ""lead
manager Red Zone training program.' That program called for the senior bankers, senior
10
research analysts, and Capital Markets personnel to ""go through this special training
seminar [focused] on pitching for the lead on public equity transactions.""
11
(ii)
Lead Manager Protocol
12
15.
13
In August 2000, the head of ECM's syndicate department prepared another specific effort
to gain additional lead managed offerings. In setting out his new ""Lead Manager
14
Protocol"" to all ECM employees, the head of the syndicate department stressed that the
""formal protocol of responsibilities will allow all of us-Investment Banking,
15
Research, Sales, Trading and Capital Markets-to share responsibility for the success of
each and every lead-managed offering.'
16
16.
The Lead Manager Protocol, issued in August 2000, called for:
17
18
the lead banker and lead research analyst to make a presentation to the firm's
PreCommitment Committee before any company would be considered for an
19
underwriting;
20
the research analyst to participate in a ""get-to-know-you"" session with prospective
investment banking clients as part of a ""Day at Piper"" session;
21
the lead banker and senior analyst to re-present the prospective company client to
22
the Commitment Committee. The lead banker and ""senior analyst must
23
demonstrate continued due diligence effort and must provide renewed
commitment to the transaction"";
24
research and sales to ""set up a roadshow schedule to ensure a targeted and
25
efficient roadshow [and] focus on ascertaining the right accounts to see and
why these are the right accounts;""
26
27
senior analysts to ""provide aggressive pre-meeting preparation and post-meeting
follow-up to each 1-on-1 appointment;""
28
senior analysts to be ""available during critical parts of roadshow and pricing""; and
4
TITLE
011.1152214.1
CASE NO. 04-06 S
1
the senior analyst to ""coordinate with Capital Markets to sort out the aftermarket
intentions of each account.""
2
17.
The Lead Manager Protocol described a primary function of a research analyst in
3
communicating regarding the progress of the transaction once the firm had obtained a
lead management role in an IPO when it stated: ""Senior analyst will coordinate with
4
Capital Markets to communicate a consistent message regarding the progress of the
5
transaction, acting as a supporter of Capital Markets' message and not as an independent
filter The goal of the analyst is to reinforce reasonable and exceedable
6
expectations.""
7
(b)
Research Analysts ""Pitched"" for Investment Banking Deals and
Advocated for the Issuer at Roadshows
8
9
18.
USBPJ's procedures allowed for the close alignment of research analysts with investment
bankers in the same industry sector. ECM marketed to potential clients its research
10
coverage, market making and institutional sales as part of the firm's efforts to obtain
investment banking business. USBPJ used the slogan, ""One Team, One Business"" in its
11
marketing materials with prospective investment banking clients. Internally, the
company had ""transaction teams"" that included investment bankers and research analysts.
12
19.
The emphasis on securing investment banking business through pitches and then selling
13
the securities through roadshows gave rise to conflicts of interest for the research
14
analysts. In some instances, the research analyst became a prime contact person for the
company with respect to soliciting investment-banking business. For example, on May
15
10, 1999, a research analyst wrote to an officer of E-Machines, a potential investment-
banking client: ""This is my final appeal to be a part of the underwriting team. This is
16
your deal and you control the strings. All we are looking for is ten percent of the
17
economics to participate in the underwriting. This itself should be indicative of my
sincere
interest in your story.. In the final analysis, it is less important to have bulge
18
bracket firm as a hood ornament than it is to have a quality analyst who will provide you
with the support and coverage your company needs.""
19
(c)
Research Analysts' Participation in Pitch Meetings Was Important in
20
Obtaining Investment Banking Mandates
21
20.
Before USBPJ made its ""pitches"" to an issuer for investment banking business, the
22
investment banker, teamed with a research analyst for the appropriate sector, would make
a presentation to USBPJ's Pre-Commitment Committee. This presentation included a
23
recommendation and analysis detailing why the firm should pursue an investment
banking relationship with the issuer. After USBPJ determined to compete for a
24
company's investment banking business, particularly in the case of an initial public
offering (""IPO""), the research analyst's role was influential in obtaining that business.
25
21.
26
One aspect of a research analyst's function was to play a key role in the process to
""pitch"" USBPJ to the prospective client. In certain instances, a research analyst's role at
27
a pitch meeting with an issuer was to assist investment banking personnel in convincing
the issuer that USBPJ should be chosen as the lead managing underwriter for the
28
offering. A research analyst's presence suggested that the Research Department would
5
TITLE
CASE NO. 04-06 S
011.1152214.1
1
work hand-in-hand with the investment bankers to provide service and support for the
issuer. Research analysts routinely appeared with investment bankers at pitch meetings
2
designed to help sell USBPJ to the potential client and provided information relating to
their research in pitchbooks given to prospective client companies.
3
4
(d)
In Certain Instances, Pitchbooks Provided to Potential Investment
Banking Clients Contained Mock Research Reports Impliedly
5
Promising Favorable Research
6
22.
When investment bankers and research analysts presented ""pitches"" to prospective
investment banking clients, USBPJ typically gave the prospective client a pitchbook
7
explaining the proposed services to be provided by the firm. These pitchbooks detailed,
in a most favorable manner, why USBPJ should be selected to underwrite the offering.
8
In addition to providing information about how USBPJ would conduct the underwriting,
9
the pitchbooks routinely included a roadmap of the amount and type of research coverage
that USBPJ would provide to support the company if it obtained the investment banking
10
business. In certain instances, USBPJ included a ""mock"" research report for the
companies, containing a valuation analysis and ""mock"" rating such as ""buy,' impliedly
11
promising to the issuer that the research analyst would issue a favorable research report if
12
it selected USBPJ for the investment banking business. In some instances, USBPJ's
mock research reports also included a favorable ""mock"" target price for the issuer's
13
stock.
14
23.
For example, in August 2000, USBPJ made a pitch to be the lead underwriter for an
offering by TheraSense, a medical technology issuer. In preparing for the pitch, a
15
research analyst prepared a mock research report about the issuer and presented that
mock report at the pitch meeting. The mock research report noted in several places a
16
proposed rating of ""Strong Buy."" The mock report contained very positive news about
17
the company, claiming that its initial sales of the product were ""nothing short of
breathtaking."" In part, as a result of that pitch, the company awarded USBPJ the role of
18
lead managing underwriter, which generated underwriting fees of $3,785,512 for the firm
when the offering went effective in October 2001. USBPJ initiated coverage of the issuer
19
with a ""Strong Buy"" recommendation shortly after the offering went effective.
20
24.
Finally, after USBPJ was awarded an investment-banking mandate, another key function
21
for a research analyst was to provide meaningful support to the firm's institutional
investor clients to ensure that an underwriting was successful. Investment bankers,
22
research analysts and company representatives generally traveled to the offices of
institutional investor clients, to meet with them and describe the offering and determine
23
their interest in purchasing the stock. At times, research analysts attended and provided
significant assistance at these ""roadshow"" meetings.
24
25
(3)
USBPJ Tied Research Analysts' Compensation to Investment Banking
Revenue
26
25.
During the relevant period, USBPJ compensated research analysts, in part, based on the
27
amount of investment banking revenue generated within their respective industry sector.
This practice created a conflict of interest for research analysts, since analysts were
28
6
TITLE
011.1152214.1
CASE NO. 04-06 S
1
compensated, in part, on issuing objective research and on the firm's success in obtaining
investment-banking business.
2
26.
Specifically, USBPJ paid certain analysts a percentage of investment banking revenue
3
and institutional commissions generated by companies in their industry sector. The firm
entered into written agreements with at least 16 research analysts to pay them a defined
4
percentage of the revenue generated by the companies they covered. This included
5
revenue from net underwriting profits, institutional sales commissions, trading
commissions, equity and debt management fees, mergers and acquisition advisory fees,
6
equity and debt private placement fees, research checks, and syndicate trading profits.
The defined percentage set forth in these written agreements ranged from a guaranteed
7
7 to 15 percent of the revenues generated by the companies in their industry sector.
8
27.
Compensation for other research analysts was comprised of base salary plus a bonus.
9
Investment banking revenue was a significant factor in determining the bonus. The
bonus was based, in part, on investment banking revenue received from companies in the
10
specific industry sector that each analyst covered, and the level of contribution the
research analyst made in the effort to obtain the investment banking business. The bonus
11
usually formed the majority of a research analyst's total compensation. In 1999 and
2000, for example, more than 85 percent of a typical research analysts' compensation
12
came from the bonus, while in 2001 approximately 77 percent of a typical research
13
analyst's compensation was in the form of a bonus. During that time, research analysts'
salaries generally ranged from $60,000 to $250,000, while the discretionary bonuses
14
ranged from $75,000 to $4,000,000.
15
28.
In determining the amount of discretionary bonuses, supervisors in the research
department considered, among other things, a research analyst's contributions to the
16
firm's success in obtaining investment-banking revenues. Performance evaluations of the
17
research analysts demonstrate this consideration. Research analysts received periodic
reports detailing the year-to-date revenues generated by their covered companies. At
18
times, senior investment bankers provided these reports to the research analysts, as well
as to investment banking employees, and listed the projected investment banking revenue
19
goals for the covered companies. One supervisor noted in a performance evaluation that
a certain analyst should work on becoming a ""lead managing analyst."" That expression
20
was a reference to the lead managing underwriter position that USBPJ sought in offerings
21
because it resulted in the greatest amount of control and revenue. Thus, the supervisor's
expression acknowledged the role that an analyst could play at USBPJ in obtaining
22
investment-banking business. For example, one senior analyst received a salary of
$160,000 and a bonus of over $3.8 million. In another example, an analyst received a
23
salary of $130,000 and a bonus of over $3 million. In both of these instances, the bonus
determination included consideration of investment banking and trading revenues for
24
companies in the industry sector covered by the analyst.
25
29.
The fact that research analysts contributed to the firm's efforts to obtain investment-
26
banking revenue is also evident from the personal goals set by certain research analysts.
Some analysts, in setting forth their goals, stated specific investment banking revenue
27
goals and listed the ongoing support of investment banking and sales as important to their
continued success.

CASE NO. 04-06 S

Investment Bankers Evaluated Research Analysts' Performance and
Influenced Their Bonus Compensation
2
30.
In 2000 and 2001, investment bankers who worked on investment banking business with
3
research analysts participated in the annual performance evaluations of those research
4
analysts. Specifically, in certain instances, investment bankers completed and provided to
the Director of Research a ""Banker Peer Review"" on certain research analysts.
5
Investment bankers evaluated research analysts using specific criteria, including:
6
""proactively generates and shares valuable M&A/strategic ideas;""
7
""prepares for pitches and contributes to preparation of pitchbook;""
8
""effective in pitches; [and] takes the aftermarket commitment seriously.""
9
31.
Thus, investment bankers provided significant input in the performance evaluation of
10
research analysts which, in turn, influenced the bonus compensation of those research
analysts. For example, an investment banker noted in his banker peer review that a
11
particular analyst: ""needs to be proactive in pursuing fee-generating companies for his
coverage list. He is very focused on big cap names that do not pay.""
12
32.
This review process indicated to research analysts that, in part, their role was to assist the
13
investment bankers and the firm's investment banking clients.
14
(5)
USBPJ Lacked Procedures and Did Not Adequately Monitor Research
15
Analysts' Sharing of Draft Research Reports With Issuers
16
33.
In certain cases, prior to the dissemination of research reports, USBPJ research analysts
provided copies of their draft reports to an issuer's executives, and solicited comments
17
and suggestions for such reports. Providing draft research reports to an issuer's
executives could potentially compromise a research analysts' independence in that the
18
investment banking clients may pressure the analyst to make inappropriate changes to the
19
draft report.
20
34.
Certain draft research reports provided to an issuer included not only the factual portions
of a draft report, but also the analyst's valuation, rating and suggested target price. In
21
some cases, company executives were given electronic copies of the research report, and
returned to the firm a ""red-lined"" version of the report with their comments and edits.
22
For example, on September 27, 2001, a USBPJ research analyst sent a representative of
23
Genta, Inc. an e-mail containing a draft report with a rating. This e-mail stated, "" Hope
you are doing better. Here is a draft of our initiation note. Please review it and send me
24
any comments you may have. Thanks... On October 2, 2001, Genta responded to the
e-mail with extensive comments on the note.
25
35.
In other instances, USBPJ investment bankers suggested to issuer clients that research
26
reports initiating coverage would be subject to approval by the issuer. For example, on
27
January 11, 2001, an investment banker wrote to numerous executives at Metromedia
Fiber Network, Inc. (""Metromedia"") thanking them for their meeting with a USBPJ
28
senior research analyst. The banker wrote, ""[The analyst] has decided to initiate
coverage with a Strong On Buy, our firm's highest recommendation his research
8
TITLE

1
associate will be calling you later today to request help in finalizing the report. Nothing
will be published without your prior approval. (Emphasis added). On January 26,
2
2001, USBPJ initiated coverage of Metromedia with a ""strong buy"" and a $27 price
target.
3
36.
4
November 22, 2000, a USBPJ senior investment banker wrote to executives of Qwest
thanking them for an in-person meeting. The banker wrote: ""We expect to initiate
5
research coverage within the next few weeks and will submit a draft of such report for
your review and approval prior to publication.""
6
37.
Notwithstanding the potential that research analysts could be subjected to pressure by
7
issuers, USBPJ failed to have adequate procedures or controls to monitor such
communications.
8
9
(6)
USBPJ Lacked Procedures And Controls Sufficient To Monitor The
Influence of Investment Banking on Research Analysts
10
38.
In view of the interaction between research analysts and investment banking described
11
above, USBPJ lacked adequate systems or procedures to supervise the influence that
investment-banking opportunities had on research personnel. For example, on January
12
17, 2001, a USBPJ senior research analyst wrote an e-mail to a junior analyst seeking
13
input as to whether he should maintain a ""buy"" rating on Natural Microsystems, Inc.
(""NMSS""). USBPJ had downgraded NMSS from ""strong buy"" in December 2000 based
14
on the company's announcement that it would likely miss its earnings projections for the
year. Upon the company's announcement in January 2001 that it had, in fact, not met its
15
projections for 2000, the senior analyst again evaluated the company's rating. In
16
response to the senior analyst's request for input, the junior analyst responded that, in his
opinion, the company should stay a ""buy"" ""taking into consideration banking
17
relationship,' but that absent such considerations he would rate the stock a neutral.

On January 18, 2001, USBPJ issued a research report that maintained the previously
2
lowered ""buy"" rating. The report included a lower price target than that published
19
previously, cautionary statements about NMSS's short-term prospects and a predicted
""struggle"" for the company's shares during the first half of 2001. In the same research
20
report, USBPJ lowered its revenue estimates by almost one half and reduced the earnings
21
per share to show a loss in fiscal year 2001. At that time, USBPJ defined a ""buy"" rating
as: ""Expect positive price appreciation over next 12 months; Solid long term company
22
fundamentals; attractive long-term valuation, though shares may be extended based on
near-term parameters."" USBPJ subsequently lowered its rating to ""neutral"" on
23
April 12, 2001.
24
40.
Moreover, USBPJ rarely issued a sell rating. During most of the review period, USBPJ
25
had a four point rating scale: strong buy, buy, neutral, and sell. More than 80 percent of
the research reports issued contained either ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" recommendations, with
26
less than 20 percent of the companies, on average, rated as a ""neutral."" Throughout the
27

USBPJ widely distributed its research through public services such as Thompson
28
Financial's First Call and on its website www.gotoanalyst.com

review period, USBPJ gave less than one percent of companies a ""sell"" recommendation.
In certain cases, the firm would discontinue coverage, usually without explanation, rather
2
than drop a company to a sell rating. In those cases, therefore, USBPJ had only a three
point rating system.

C.
USBPJ Issued Research on Two Companies That Lacked a Reasonable Basis Or
4
Was Imbalanced
5
41.
As to two companies, Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. and Triton Network Systems, USBPJ
6
issued research reports that lacked a reasonable basis or were imbalanced.
7
(1)
Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.
8
42.
In August 2000, USBPJ served as co-manager for the IPO of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.
(""Esperion"") and consequently initiated research coverage of Esperion on September 5,
9
2000 with a ""buy"" rating. On January 9, 2002, a USBPJ senior research analyst stated in
10
an e-mail to a senior investment banker: ""ESPR delayed a pipeline product and
completely dropped development of a second pipeline product, giving a reason that was
11
nothing short of hokey. So it was bad news all around Esperion has not met a single
milestone that they have laid out since they went public. Everything has slipped.
12
[Esperion's CEO] is a good scientist, an awful CEO.""
13
43.
Notwithstanding these statements, USBPJ's January 2002 industry report ""Investing in
14
Biotechnology"" and research report on January 24, 2002, both reiterated the existing buy
rating (now termed outperform).
15
(2)
Triton Network Systems
16
44.
In July 2000, USBPJ served as co-manager for Triton Network Systems (""Triton"")'s IPO.
17
On August 7, 2000, a USBPJ senior research analyst initiated research coverage of Triton
with a ""buy"" rating and a $45 price target. Soon after the IPO, shares of Triton reached a
18
high of $47.75, but the value of the stock quickly declined. USBPJ maintained a ""buy""
19
rating while the stock price declined to $1 13/16 over the next eight months.
20
45.
On March 30, 2001, the analyst issued a ""blast"" e-mail to institutional clients with
cautionary statements about Triton due to the likely loss of a key customer, Advanced
21
Radio Telecom, which was considering a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Other than the
""blast"" e-mail, USBPJ did not issue a new research report directly on that information at
22
that time. Notwithstanding this negative news, USBPJ maintained a ""buy"" rating.
23
Another month passed before USBPJ disclosed in a broadly disseminated research report
Triton's problems with this customer while downgrading Triton to a neutral on
24
May 1, 2001. After two more months, when Triton was trading below $1, the research
analyst told the head of USBPJ's equity research department, that since the company was
25
in bankruptcy proceedings, ""we can drop now if banking says ok."" USBPJ discontinued
coverage of Triton with a last published rating of neutral.

USBPJ Threatened to Drop Research Coverage of Emisphere Technologies, Inc., if
it Did Not Award USBPJ the Lead Manager Role in an Offering
2
46.
In September 1999, USBPJ attempted to compel Emisphere Technologies, Inc. to select it
3
for investment banking business by informing company executives that it would drop
research coverage of the company if it were not selected as the lead manager for an
4
offering of Emisphere's securities. USBPJ's threatening conduct undermined
5
competition for investment banking services.
6
E.
USBPJ Failed to Disclose That it Received Payments From Proceeds of Certain
Underwritings, In Part, To Publish Research Regarding The Issuer
7
47.
From 1999 through 2001, USBPJ received payments out of the proceeds of certain
8
underwritings to compensate the firm for services that included publishing research on
9
the issuer. These payments were made in the form of ""research guarantees"" or ""research
checks."" During this period, USBPJ accepted more than $1.8 million in exchange for,
10
among other services, issuing research reports. Despite having an obligation to do so, the
firm failed to disclose in research reports or elsewhere that it received the payments, in
11
part, as compensation for issuing the reports. For example:
12
48.
In June 1999, USBPJ received a $400,000 research check in connection with a $200
13
million high yield debt offering in April 1999 for Just for Feet. USBPJ was not a
manager on the offering and did not disclose this payment in its ongoing research or
14
elsewhere.
15
49.
In July 1999, USBPJ received a $150,000 check in connection with an offering of
common stock by JDS Uniphase Corp. Although USBPJ was not an underwriter in the
16
offering, the firm received the payment, in part, for continued research coverage of the
17
company.
18
50.
In March 2001, USBPJ received a $120,000 research check in connection with an
underwriting that went effective in May 2001 for Comverse Technology Inc. USBPJ
19
failed to disclose in research it published on the company that it had received this
compensation, in part, for issuing research regarding the subject company.
20
F.
USBPJ Failed to Ensure Public Disclosure of Payments It Made from the Proceeds
21
of Underwritings to Brokerage Firms To Issue Research Coverage Regarding Its
22
Investment Banking Clients
23
51.
From 1999 through 2001, at the direction of certain issuer clients, USBPJ paid portions of
certain underwriting proceeds to other brokerage firms to initiate or continue research
24
coverage on issuers for which Piper served as lead or co-manager. It knew that these
payments were, in part, for research. USBPJ did not take steps to ensure that the
25
brokerage firms paid to initiate or continue coverage of its investment banking clients
26
disclosed that they had been paid to issue such research. Further, USBPJ did not disclose
or cause to be disclosed the fact of such payments.
27
52.
For example, in 2000, USBPJ paid underwriting proceeds of $100,000 to another
28
underwriter in conjunction with USBPJ's lead manager position on Onyx
Pharmaceuticals' (""Onyx"") stock offering. While this underwriter was not invited to
11
TITLE
011.1152214.1
CASE NO. 04-06 S
1
participate in Onyx's offering, the payment was made in response to a letter dated
September 22, 2000 from the underwriter asking for $300,000 in ""underwriting
2
participation"" for continued research and market making. A representative of the
underwriter wrote, ""From August 31, 1999 until August 15, 2000, we were the only firm
3
in print on Onyx Pharmaceuticals and we remain a Strong Buy rating."" USBPJ did not
4
ensure that this payment was disclosed to the public in its published research on Onyx.
5
53.
In April 2000, USBPJ, acting as lead manager for an offering for Buca, Inc. directed the
payment of an aggregate of $105,000 to three brokerage firms for the issuance of
6
research. In February 2001, while assisting in another investment banking transaction for
Buca, Inc., USBPJ distributed $225,000 to other firms for their research coverage.
7
USBPJ did not ensure that these payments were disclosed to the public.
8
G.
USBPJ Failed to Adequately Supervise Its Research Analysts and Investment
9
Banking Professionals
10
54.
During the relevant period, USBPJ's management failed adequately to monitor the
activities of the firm's research and investment banking professionals to ensure
11
compliance with state securities laws and regulations. Among other things, this failure to
supervise gave rise to and perpetuated the above-described violative conduct.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
15
1.
The division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Alaska Securities Act.
16
2.
The division finds that Respondent USBPJ engaged in acts and practices that created
and/or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts
17
and therefore imposed conflicts of interest on research analysts. USBPJ failed to manage
18
these conflicts in an adequate and appropriate manner. AS 45.55.025
19
3.
The division finds that Respondent USBPJ has committed dishonest and unethical
practices under AS 45.55.025, as described in the Findings of Fact above, by issuing
20
research that contained opinions for which there was no reasonable basis and/or
exaggerated or unwarranted claims.
21
4.
The division finds that Respondent USBPJ inappropriately threatened executives of a
22
potential investment-banking client by stating that they would drop research coverage of
23
the company if the firm was not selected as the lead manager in an investment banking
transaction. AS 45.55.025
24
5.
The division finds that Respondent USBPJ received compensation directly or indirectly,
25
from an issuer, underwriter or dealer, in part, for issuing research reports, without fully
disclosing the receipt or the amount of the compensation. AS 445.55.025.
26
6.
The division finds that Respondent USBPJ, as described in the Findings of Fact above,
27
made payments for research to other broker-dealers not involved in an underwriting
28
transaction, when the firm knew that these payments were made, at least in part, for
12
TITLE
CASE NO. 04-06 S
011.1152214.1
1
research coverage, and failed to disclose or cause to be disclosed in offering documents
or elsewhere the fact of such payments. AS 45.55.025.
2
7.
The division finds that Respondent USBPJ failed to establish and enforce written
3
supervisory procedures reasonably designed to ensure that analysts were not unduly
influenced by investment banking concerns. Despite knowledge of research analysts'
4
complex responsibilities and conflicts of interest, Respondent USBPJ failed to implement
5
a system to detect and insulate its research analysts from improper influence and pressure
by investment banking personnel. To the contrary, Respondent USBPJ's business
6
practices motivated research analysts to issue research that would attract and retain
investment-banking business. AS 845.55.060.

8.
The division finds the following relief appropriate and in the public interest.

25
Alaska as a civil monetary penalty pursuant to the agreement of the parties, to be

Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of

FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Background and Jurisdiction
5
1) UBS Warburg became a member organization of the Exchange on September 6, 1985. Union It is
6
principally owned by UBS AG (UBS AG was formed through the June 1998 merger of
Bank of Switzerland with Swiss Bank Corporation) and is engaged in the business of global
7
investment banking and securities. UBS Warburg also provides services on a worldwide
basis, including investment banking, securities trading and principal investments, and asset
8
management. The principal office of UBS Warburg is located at 677 Washington Boulevard,
in Stamford, Connecticut.
9
2) PaineWebber Inc. (""PaineWebber""), founded in 1879, was a full-service securities firm
located in New York, and became a member of the Exchange on November 17, 1982. The
10
services provided by PaineWebber, on a global basis, included investment banking,
research, trading, investing on a principal basis, and asset management.
11
3) On November 3, 2000, UBS AG purchased PaineWebber and PaineWebber became known the
12
as UBS PaineWebber. UBS PaineWebber is indirectly owned by UBS AG. As part of
merger, PaineWebber banking and research activities were shifted to UBS Warburg LLC,
13
and some investment bankers and research analysts previously employed by PaineWebber
became employees of UBS Warburg LLC. Since the merger, UBS PaineWebber is
14
principally engaged in the business of servicing retail investors and no longer employs
equity investment bankers or research analysts. UBS PaineWebber's York. principal office is
15
located at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
16
4) UBS AG has offices in over 50 countries, employing approximately 69,500 people, 35,000 of
whom work for UBS PaineWebber or UBS Warburg. UBS Warburg has 90 stock exchange
17
memberships in 30 countries and the firm's 500 equity research analysts cover about 3,300
companies world-wide.
18
5) UBS Warburg and UBS PaineWebber are registered with the Exchange, SEC, NASD and
with all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
19
B. Overview
20
6) This action concerns the research and investment banking activities at UBS Warburg during
21
the period July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2001 as well as the research and investment
banking activities at PaineWebber from July 1, 1999 until its merger with UBS AG on
22
November 3, 2000 (the ""relevant periods"").
23
7)
During the relevant period, as set forth below, the Firm sought and did investment banking
business with many companies covered by the Firm's Research Department. Research a
24
factor considered in the analysts' compensation. In addition, the decision to initiate
analysts were encouraged to participate in investment banking activities and that was and
25
maintain research coverage of certain companies was in some cases coordinated with the
Investment Banking Department and influenced by investment banking interests.
1
8) As a result of the foregoing, as set forth below, certain research analysts at the Firm were the
subject to investment banking influences and conflicts of interest between supporting
2
investment banking business at the Firm and publishing objective research.
3
9) As set forth below, the Firm had knowledge of these investment banking influences and
conflicts of interest, yet failed to establish and maintain adequate policies, systems and
procedures with respect to research analysts that were reasonably designed to detect and
4
prevent those influences or manage those conflicts.
5
C. The Role of the Research Analyst
6
10) Research analysts were responsible for providing analyses of the financial outlook of
particular companies in the context of the business sectors in which those companies
7
operate and the securities markets as a whole.
8
11) The Firm publishes research on publicly traded companies based upon analysts' examining,
among other things, financial information contained in public filings, questioning company
9
management, investigating customer and supplier relationships, evaluating companies'
business plans and the products or services offered, building financial models, and
10
analyzing competitive trends.
11
12) After synthesizing and analyzing this information, analysts produced research in the form of
full reports and more abbreviated formats that typically contained a rating, a price target,
and a summary and analysis of the factors that generated the rating and/or price target.
12
The Firm then distributed its analysts' research reports to the Firm's institutional clients, to
the Firm's sales force and to retail clients upon request. Research reports were also made
13
available to third party vendors, such as Bloomberg and First Call, who then made the
reports available to subscribers to those vendors. In addition, the rating, but not the analysis
14
contained in the research report, was published on Internet websites such as Multex, for
viewing by the investing public. Similarly, UBS Warburg posted on its website (and provided its
15
in hard copy if requested), monthly summaries concerning the companies covered by
research analysts, the ratings issued, and any ratings changes from the previous month.
16
These summaries did not include any of the analyses contained in the actual research
reports.
17
13) Analysts were required according to UBS Warburg policy to submit any proposed rating
18
upgrades or downgrades and initiations of coverage to an Investment Review Committee
(""IRC"") that consisted of compliance, institutional sales, equity capital markets and research
19
department personnel. The IRC reviewed analysts' reports and approved rating and target
changes as well as initiations of coverage.
20
14) Nevertheless, analysts were sometimes able to upgrade or downgrade ratings by requesting
and receiving approval of one of several designated members of Research Management,
21
who were also members of the IRC, rather than the full IRC, whenever that change in rating
was based upon breaking news. Because Firm analysts sometimes changed their ratings
22
based upon breaking news, upgrades or downgrades were authorized without the approval
of the full IRC in nearly one-third of the instances in which ratings were changed during the
23
Relevant Period.
24
15) Analysts also made themselves available to the Firm's institutional and retail sales force to
answer questions about the sector and the covered companies. In addition, analysts
25
provided periodic research updates to the Firm's sales force through ""morning calls"" or
""morning notes,"" which are daily pre-market opening discussions of the market sectors and
specific covered companies. Analysts also provided research updates through ""blast"" e-
1
mails and voice messages, which typically provide a rating and a more abbreviated analysis
than what is contained in a research report.
2
16) During the Relevant Period, analysts were expected to make independent determinations
3
regarding coverage, stock price targets and ratings whether to buy, sell or hold certain
stocks, without consideration of their research reports' potential impact upon Firm
investment banking business or the business of Firm investment banking clients.
4
17) In the 1990's the importance of research issued by analysts increased as a result of the
5
dramatic growth in the number of individual investors and the availability of online trading.
Research coverage became a marketing tool, and issuers sometimes chose an investment
6
bank based upon the expectation that a certain analyst would cover the company's stock
favorably.
7
18) As the performance and coverage of research analysts became increasingly integral to the
8
awarding of investment banking business, the Firm encouraged its research analysts to
become more involved in investment banking activities, including marketing securities
9
issued by investment banking clients (primarily to the Firm's institutional clients) and
soliciting investment banking business.
10
D. Research Analyst Participation in Investment Banking Activities
11
19) The Investment Banking Division at the Firm advised corporate clients and helped them
execute various financial transactions, including the issuance of stock and other securities.
12
The Firm frequently served as one of the underwriters in initial public offerings (""IPOs"") - the
first public issuance of stock of a company that has not previously been traded - and follow-
13
on offerings of securities.
14 20) During the relevant period, investment banking was an important source of revenues and
profits for UBS Warburg. UBS Warburg's investment banking department reported global
15
revenues of $1.369 billion in 1999, $1.602 billion in 2000 and $1.369 billion in 2001,
representing nearly 15% of UBS Warburg's global revenues during that time period.
16
21) In addition to performing research functions, some of the Firm's research analysts identified
17
companies as prospects for investment banking services, participated in ""pitches"" of the
Firm's investment banking services to companies, and participated in ""roadshows"" and other
18
activities in connection with the marketing of underwriting transactions. At times, Firm
research analysts were involved in meetings between companies, prior to their IPO's, and
19
some of the Firm's institutional customers who had expressed an interest in purchasing
shares in those IPOs. These meetings would take place in various cities all over the country
in order to accommodate the institutional customers and were commonly known in the
20
industry as ""analyst roadshows.""
21
22) During these roadshows, the analyst would discuss the issuer with the institutional
customers and would frequently arrange ""one on one"" meetings between company
22
executives and managers of institutional clients who had expressed interest in investing.
These roadshows were considered to be a service provided by the Firm to both its
23
institutional clients as well as its investment banking clients.
24
23) Research analysts also participated in commitment committee and due diligence activities in
connection with underwriting activities and assisted the Investment Banking Department in
25
providing merger and acquisition and other advisory services to companies.
24) The interactions between investment bankers and certain research analysts during the
1
Relevant Period, at times impacted the independence of those analysts' as they became
2
result, an environment was created that may have led certain analysts to believe that they
increasingly involved in the Firm's efforts to secure investment banking business. As a
were expected to initiate and maintain positive research about Firm clients.
3
E.
Participation in Investment Banking Activities was a Factor in Evaluating and
Compensating Research Analysts
4
25) The compensation system at the Firm provided an incentive for research analysts to
5
participate in investment activities and to assist in generating investment banking business
for the Firm.
6
26) The performance of research analysts was evaluated by Research Management through unles
a
7
annual review process and analysts' bonuses were determined through this process,
an analyst had a guaranteed bonus set by contract in advance. The guaranteed bonuses W
8
for the Firm's top analysts were frequently in the millions of dollars while the base salary
typically in the $125,000 to $150,000 range.
9
27) In addition to these guaranteed bonuses, six PaineWebber analysts were explicitly
10
guaranteed ""investment banking bonuses"", meaning that those analysts were entitled to
some portion of certain investment banking fees earned by PaineWebber.
11
28) For example, two PaineWebber analysts were promised compensation equal to 15% the of the
12
two analysts received an additional $125,000 and $135,000, respectively, for the year sector 200
bonuses paid to those analysts pursuant to PaineWebber's annual review process, those
underwriting management fees earned in their respective sectors. In addition to
13
because of the investment banking fees earned by PaineWebber in their respective
14
29) When UBS Warburg acquired the research and investment banking operations of
PaineWebber in November, 2000, the Firm removed the direct link between investment
15
banking revenues and analyst compensation.
16
30) The UBS annual evaluation process included an evaluation of each analyst's contribution
the Firm's investment banking business as a factor in determining bonus compensation.
17
31) Each year, prior to bonuses being paid, UBS conducted a comprehensive evaluation
process that rated each analyst's performance and assigned analysts rankings in one of
f
18
quartiles. As part of that process, analysts submitted self-evaluations, and other UBS
19
employees with whom the analyst had had significant contact were also asked to submit
evaluations, including investment bankers.
20
32) In describing the analysts' performance, the UBS bankers frequently included comments
relating to the analyst's abilities to attract and/or maintain investment banking clients.
21
33) For example, an investment banker at UBS Warburg evaluated one analyst as ""the best
22
business builder in research 1 have ever known.""
23
34) Similarly, Research Management considered investment banking contributions as a
component of analysts' performance evaluations. The Head of UBS Warburg's Research come
24
to generating investment banking revenues"" and that he ""manages the tightest coordinati W
Division evaluated that same analyst as the ""most prolific analyst at the firm when it
25
between research and [the Corporate Finance Division] of any sector.' This evaluation
included in the section of the performance review entitled ""Accomplishment/Strengths.
1
35) Furthermore, the Head of UBS Warburg's Research Division, who was ultimately
responsible for evaluating analysts and determining the exact amount of their bonus
2
compensation, referenced analysts' contributions to investment banking business as one
factor in the evaluation of their performance.
3
36) The Firm also specifically requested that analysts, in writing their own self-evaluations,
include, among other criteria, an assessment of their contribution to the Firm's Investment
4
Banking Department. This led to a perception among analysts that contribution to
investment banking was a factor in compensation.
5
37) In response to this request, one analyst described his own performance for the Firm by
6
highlighting his involvement with several investment banking deals done by the Firm during
the previous year. The analyst then boasted that he was responsible for generating $15
7
million in investment banking revenue for the Firm during that time.
8
F. Investment Banking Interests Influenced the Firm's Decisions to Initiate
and Maintain Research Coverage
9
38) In general, the Firm determined whether to initiate and maintain research coverage based
10
upon investor interest in a company or based upon investment banking considerations, such
as attracting companies to generate investment banking business or maintaining a positive
11
relationship with existing investment banking clients.
39) As a matter of practice, the Firm initiated coverage on companies that engaged the Firm in
12
an investment banking transaction and maintained coverage for a period of time beyond the
transaction.
13
40) Research analysts were aware that, in certain circumstances, their positive and continued
14
coverage of particular companies was an important factor for the generation of investment
banking business. Thus, some research analysts and investment bankers coordinated the
15
initiation and maintenance of research coverage based upon, among other things,
investment banking considerations.
16
41) For example, analysts were required to seek authorization from Research Management prior
17
to dropping coverage of a company, unless the reason for dropping coverage was due the
departure of the covering analyst. However, when the company involved was an investment
18
banking client, the analyst was also expected to consult with the investment banking
personnel responsible to that client.
19
42) Additionally, according to an e-mail by UBS Warburg Head of Global Technology Investment
Banking, it was an implicit condition in the UBS Warburg investment banking agreements
20
that UBS Warburg would continue to provide research coverage of its clients for a period of
time following a transaction. Such implied promises to investment banking clients impacted
21
the Research Department's authority to make its own independent determinations
concerning the continuation of coverage.
22
43) When a UBS Warburg analyst informed the Head of the Research Department that he
23
intended to drop coverage of a particular company, he was asked whether there was any
""banking relationship"" and was told to ""check with"" the banker who worked with that
24
company.
25
44) Although coverage of the company was dropped in that instance, the lead banker of the
technology group at UBS Warburg reminded the research analyst and Research
Management of the implicit promise made during pitch meetings that coverage would be
1
maintained for a significant period of time: ""The problem is that many companies
in
asking for credentials for a pitch will ask directly if we are meeting our research obligations
2
to the companies we bank. They generally expect an IPO fee to justify coverage for three
years
3
45) In another instance, when a UBS Warburg research analyst informed his banking
4
counterpart, that he intended to drop coverage of four biotechnology companies, the banker
forwarded that message to a member of Investment Banking Management who sent an e-
mail to the analyst stating that he wished ""to have the opportunity to discuss future potential
5
revenue opportunities from these clients"" before coverage was dropped.
6
46) The Investment Banking Department also sometimes had an impact upon determinations
made by analysts regarding the initiation of coverage. When investment bankers became
7
aware of opportunities to cultivate investment banking business, they sometimes suggested
to the analyst in that sector that coverage should be initiated.
8
47) For example, a Firm investment banker sent an e-mail to a Firm research analyst indicating
9
that a company with whom he had discussed investment banking business had asked ""if
there was an interest by UBS Warburg to cover them from a research stand point."" The
10
banker went on to say that he believed that ""the timing is good"" for initiation of research
coverage of the company and offered to set up a meeting between the company and the
11
analyst.
12
48) Similarly, a Firm analyst informed his banking counterparts that they should wait to call a
company to discuss a potential investment banking deal until ""after I pick up coverage.""
13
G. The Firm's Pitch Materials Contained Discussions of Research Coverage
14
49) During the relevant period, research coverage was an important factor considered by
companies in selecting a firm for an investment banking transaction.
15
50) Certain analysts understood that the issuance of positive research about an issuer was a
16
pre-condition to the Firm's obtaining the issuer's banking business.
17
51) In competing for investment banking business from prospective issuers, the Firm typically
sent investment bankers to meet with company management in order to persuade the
18
company to select the Firm as one of the underwriters in a contemplated transaction.
Research analysts often accompanied bankers on these ""pitch"" meetings. At these
19
meetings, Firm investment bankers would present their level of expertise in the company's
sector and discuss their previous experience with other companies, as well as their view of
20
the company's merits and likelihood of success.
21
52) In some instances, the research analyst's coverage and impact on the market place
concerning companies under coverage was a component of the pitch presented by the Firm.
As a result of these presentations, certain issuers selected an investment bank because of
22
the reputation of the analyst that would cover the company's stock and the issuer's belief
that the coverage would be positive.
23
53) Furthermore, certain research analysts who covered the company's sector often worked with
24
investment bankers to prepare the Firm's pitch presentation and attended the pitch meeting.
25
54) In preparation for each presentation, the investment bankers, sometimes with an analyst's
input, prepared a ""pitch book"" that was distributed at the meeting and contained a summary
of the Firm's presentation.
1
55) Some pitch books contained information relating to the company, its competition, the sector
in which it operated and the nature of the services the Firm could provide to the company
2
and its shareholders after the completion of a potential offering. Additionally, Firm pitch
I
books sometimes contained implicit representations that the Firm would continue to provide
service to the issuer after the offering by providing research coverage about the company.
3
56) Some pitch books contained information indicating that a specific analyst would cover the
4
company and included data demonstrating how that analyst's positive comments about
other companies in the sector had had a direct positive impact upon the stock prices of
5
those companies.
6
57) For example, the pitch book presented to JDS Uniphase by PaineWebber, discussed the
impact that PaineWebber research had on covered stocks by including a graphic depicting
7
the performance of stocks on the Firm's ""Buy List"" as opposed to stocks on the Firm's
""Attractive List"" and ""Neutral List."" At the top of the graphic, PaineWebber quoted a report
8
from Reuters which stated, ""Shares of semiconductor companies specializing in chips for the
communications market rose on Thursday after PaineWebber published a report citing the
9
sector's growth prospects.""
10
58) Similarly, in a pitch book presented to Avant Immunotherapeutics, Inc., PaineWebber
presented a slide entitled ""Demonstrated Strength in Equity Trading and Research. One of
11
the sub-topics on the slide stated, ""Buy and attractive recommendations have outperformed
the S&P 500 by 84 percentage points for the period 1/90 through 12/99"" while ""Sell and
unattractive ratings have underperformed the S&P 500 by 361 percentage points for the
12
period 1/90 through 12/99.'
13
59) Because analysts often participated in the Firm's efforts to win investment banking business,
analysts were sometimes subjected to competing pressures after a stock became publicly
14
traded. The type of information contained in the pitch books, such as the examples above,
implied to issuers that the Firm would provide positive research coverage if selected for an
15
investment banking transaction, and that such coverage could result in rising stock prices for
those companies.
16
H. Research Analysts Rarely Issued Neutral or Negative Ratings
17
60) During the relevant period, PaineWebber's rating system allowed research analysts exceed to
18
assign one of four ratings to a stock: ""Buy"", defined as total return expected to that
of the S&P 500 by 20 percentage points or more over the next 12 months; ""Attractive"", 12
19
month total return potential that is 10-20 percentage points greater than the market's;
""Neutral"", 12 month total return potential within 10 percentage points of the market's;
20
""Unattractive"", expected to underperform the market by more than 10 percentage points on
a total return basis over the next 12 months.
21
61) During the relevant period, UBS Warburg's rating system differed slightly from
22
PaineWebber's and allowed research analysts to assign one of five ratings to a stock:
""Strong Buy"", defined as greater than 20% excess return potential; ""Buy"", positive excess
return potential; ""Hold"", low excess return potential; ""Reduce"", negative excess return
23
potential; ""Sell"", greater than 20% negative excess return potential. All of these ratings
related to a 12 month time horizon.
24
62) During the relevant period, the level of the price target and the strength of the
25
recommendation placed on a stock by covering analysts sometimes had a significant impact
on the stock price. Investment bankers and issuers, being fully aware of the potential
1
impact of analysts' recommendations, were motivated to seek research coverage containing
positive recommendations.
2
63) In fact, certain analysts considered the investment banking implications for the Firm when
3
contemplating issuing even a neutral rating about an investment banking client. For
example, a member of Equity Sales Management, sent an e-mail to one of UBS Warburg's
telecom analysts stating ""The salesforce is extremely frustrated with your research, price
4
targets, ratings
They feel that you're being somewhat flippant and not taking
responsibility for your recommendations and for having lost hundreds of millions of dollars
5
for people."" The analyst responded that he would never utilize a Hold rating on a stock
unless one of two conditions occurred: ""1) if I believe the company is about to go bankrupt;
6
2) if there is no investment banking business to be had there.""
7
64) Notwithstanding that PaineWebber had four available ratings and UBS Warburg had five,
the Firm's research analysts rarely issued ratings other than ""Strong Buy"" and ""Buy"" on the
8
stocks of investment banking clients. Out of several thousand companies covered by UBS
Warburg during the relevant period, UBS Warburg issued only seven ""Hold"" ratings and two
9
""Sell"" ratings on companies with which it had an investment banking relationship.
10
65) Similarly, from July 1, 1999 until the time of the merger, PaineWebber issued only sixteen
""Neutral"" ratings and five ""Unattractive"" ratings on companies with which it had an
11
investment banking relationship.
1. In Certain Instances, the Firm Published Exaggerated or Unwarranted Research
12
66) On several occasions, the conflicts of interest discussed above resulted in analysts
13
publishing ratings and/or recommendations that were exaggerated or unwarranted, and/or
contained opinions for which there was no reasonable basis. The following are examples of
14
how these conflicts affected the research:
15
67) In April of 1998, UBS Warburg served as the lead manager on an IPO for Triangle
Pharmaceuticals (""Triangle"") and received $1.8 million in investment banking fees.
16
68) Notwithstanding a market capitalization value of approximately $352,000,000, in November
17
of 1999, Triangle had yet to earn any revenue. Rather, investor optimism for the stock was
based upon the anticipated approval by the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") of
18
several new drugs, including its ""lead HIV drug"", Coactinon.
19
69) In a research report issued on October 8, 1999, the UBS Warburg research analyst who
covered Triangle issued a research report that maintained a ""Buy"" rating while relaying news
to investors that a study of the drug Coactinon had proved ""inconclusive."" The analyst also
20
wrote that the form of testing used by Triangle to gain approval from the FDA had been used
before but ""had been in less favor recently,"" and that accordingly it ""is unclear what the
21
FDA's requirements will now be"" for testing the drug.
22
70) On December 10, 1999, the FDA informed the company that it would require an additional
round of testing, which would cause at least a substantial delay, and perhaps ultimately
a
23
cancellation, of the release and sale of the drug. As a result the stock price fell more than
$3 -- or 23% -- from $15.63 to $12.00 on the date of the announcement.
24
71) On that same day, the analyst published a new research report in which she relayed the
25
news to investors but maintained her ""Buy"" rating, based in part, according to the report,
upon the analyst's belief that a different drug in development by Triangle was the company's
""most important near-term opportunity.""
1
72) The analyst spoke to the UBS Warburg sales force before the market opened following
Triangle's announcement of the FDA's decision and made a statement in form or in
2
substance that the FDA's action had been an anticipated possibility notwithstanding the
analyst's ""Buy"" rating on the stock.
3
73) Following that call, a member of UBS Warburg's Equity Trading Management contacted the
analyst by e-mail and expressed disappointment that the analyst anticipated that the FDA
4
might take this action but had failed to adequately emphasize that possibility to the sales
force.
5
74) The analyst responded that her failure to emphasize negative information regarding Triangle
6
was, at least partially, a result of the analyst's allegiance to the investment banking client:
""Triangle is a very important client of [the firm]. We could not go out with a big research call
7
trashing their lead product, although we had a feeling the FDA might balk. Had we been
right or wrong, it would have been a disaster. I just wanted the salesforce to know we were
8
not surprised, and that where appropriate we had had some conversations with the buyside.
Sorry this was not conveyed.""
9
75) Similarly, in September 1999, UBS Warburg acted as a co-lead underwriter of Interspeed's
10
IPO and received approximately $700,000 in investment banking fees as a result.
11
76) In October 1999, the analyst initiated coverage on Interspeed with a ""Buy"" rating and a $15
price target and maintained that position for several months. On January 3, 2000, the Firm's
12
analyst received an e-mail from a junior analyst who asked what to do if Interspeed's annual in
report reflects inventory and a sales breakout which ""differ materially from what we have
the model."" The junior analyst also remarked that Interspeed should ""get new auditors, their
13
cash flow statement doesn't add up.""
14
77) That same day, the analyst issued a research report stating the Interspeed had fallen
""dramatically short on the top line"" in the prior quarter ""due to various consumer financing
15
and delivery issues.' Additionally, the analyst issued the ""Buy"" rating in spite of the fact that
the stock price had risen above the analyst's price target.
16
78) Two days later, on January 5, 2000, the analyst instructed a member of the Firm's sales
17
force, ""Don't put people into Interspeed - very risky."" Nevertheless, the analyst maintained
his Buy rating on the stock.
18
79) Approximately 15 minutes later, the recipient of that e-mail replied, asking ""so why is ispd
19
[stock symbol for Interspeed] a short?"" The analyst replied, ""Just lumpy revenue, some
stuffing of channel, creative accounting.""
20
80) The analyst's reference to ""customer financing and delivery issues"" in his January 3rd report
should have more fully described his concern that Interspeed was suffering from lumpy
21
revenue or channel stuffing.
22
81) A week after that, on January 11, 2000, the analyst received a question from an institutional
sales force member asking about Interspeed. He responded, ""BE CAREFUL about being
23
long Interspeed. They will report a great number for the December quarter, at least on the
surface of things, but the quality of that number is not necessarily self-evident.' (emphasis
24
in the original).
25
82) On February 4, 2000, the UBS Warburg analyst issued another research report following
1
Interspeed's announcement of its fourth quarter results, which exceeded the analyst's
2
expectations. In that report, the analyst reiterated his ""Buy"" rating and raising his price
target from $15 to $28.
3
83) On March 20, 2000, while the analyst still maintained his ""Buy"" rating and $28 price target
and with the stock price exceeding that target, the analyst sent an e-mail to UBS Warburg's
4
sales force informing them that another company had developed a product to compete with
Interspeed. One of the members of the sales force responded, ""This sounds like a short
5
correct? (Off the record, of course). The analyst responded, ""YES."" However, the analyst
still maintained the ""Buy"" rating.
6
84) On May 31, 2000, the analyst sent an e-mail to two institutional customers saying that ""The
7
two shorts of the group I would suggest are (1) [another issuer] and (2) Interspeed. l'd be
wary of shorting any of the others."" Nevertheless, the analyst still maintained his ""Buy""
8
rating on Interspeed.
9
85) On July 21, 2000, the analyst dropped the rating on Interspeed from a ""Buy"" to a ""Hold"".
10
J. UBS Warburg Received and Made Payments for Research
11
86) UBS Warburg received payments from the lead manager of offerings in which UBS Warburg
did not participate for the issuance of research during the relevant time period.
12
87) During the relevant period, UBS Warburg received a payment of $100,000 from an outside
firm in connection with the offering of Flextronics International, Ltd. The cover letter
13
enclosing the check indicated that the check was a ""special research check."" However,
UBS Warburg failed to disclose in its research reports concerning Flextronics that it had
14
received the payment, nor did it disclose the source or amount of the payment.
15
88) During the relevant period, UBS Warburg also received a payment from an outside firm in
the amount of approximately $113,000 in connection with the offering of Atmel, Inc. The
16
cover letter enclosing the check stated that the check represented ""guaranteed economics
for research.' However, UBS Warburg failed to disclose in its research reports concerning
17
Atmel that it had received the payment, nor did it disclose the source or amount of the
payment.
18
89) During the relevant period, UBS Warburg also paid a ""research fee"" of $150,000 at the
19
direction of the issuer, to two broker-dealers in conjunction with the underwriting transaction
of Netopia, Inc. in which UBS Warburg was the lead-manager. However, UBS Warburg did
not take steps to ensure that this broker-dealer disclosed in its research reports that it had
20
been paid to issue research. Further UBS Warburg did not disclose or cause to be
disclosed the details of these payments.
21
90) During the relevant period, UBS Warburg also made several payments totaling
22
approximately $283,000, at the direction of the issuer, for ""research"" to broker-dealers in
conjunction with an underwriting transaction of Espeed, Inc., in which UBS Warburg was the
23
lead manager. However, UBS Warburg did not take steps to ensure that this broker-dealer
disclosed in its research reports that it had been paid to issue research. Further UBS
24
Warburg did not disclose or cause to be disclosed the details of these payments.

17
RESPONDENTS
18
1. LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. (RESPONDENT) has been a broker-dealer registered with the
division since 1965. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a
19
Delaware corporation. The firm is a member of all principal securities and commodity
exchanges, as well as the NASD. Lehman's principal offices are located at 745 Seventh
Avenue, New York, New York. Lehman provides the full range of services offered by a multi-
20
purpose investment bank, including equity and fixed income sales, trading and research,
investment banking, private equity and private client sales
21
STATEMENT OF FACTS
22
I.
BACKGROUND
23
A.
The Investment Banking Function at Lehman
24
2. Lehman is a global investment bank providing financial advisory, capital markets and
25
underwriting services, among other services, to its clients. From at least July 1999 through at
least June 2001, Lehman's investment banking department (""Investment Banking""), among
other activities, engaged in securities offerings, including initial public offerings (""IPOs""),
1
secondary offerings and debt financings, and provided merger and acquisition and other
advisory services for its clients.
2
3. From at least July 1999 through at least June 2001, Lehman competed vigorously with other
3
investment banks to be selected as the lead manager for securities offerings, in part because of
the financial rewards associated with that role. In addition, Lehman hoped to gain ongoing
4
transactional and advisory work from existing and potential clients, including secondary
offerings and financial advisory arrangements. In 2001, Lehman served as lead manager for
5
sixty-six equity deals, and earned approximately $1.3 billion from underwriting services.
B.
Lehman's Global Equity Research Department
6
4. During 1999 and 2000, Lehman's Equity Research Department (""Research"") employed
7
approximately 400 people and expanded to 600 employees in 2001, including approximately
100 senior research analysts and 200 junior research analysts. During 2001, Research
8
covered approximately 80 industries and approximately 900 U.S. companies. Senior
research analysts in the United States reported to the Director of U.S. Equity Research,
9
who reported to the Managing Director of Global Equity Research.
10
5. Research analysts collect financial and other information about a company and its
11
industry, analyze that information, and develop recommendations and ratings regarding
a company's securities. In addition, research analysts also examine the financial
12
condition of selected publicly traded companies that are believed to be of potential
investment value. Lehman analysts also make evaluations of companies' expected
13
earnings, revenue and cash flow, operating and financial strengths and weaknesses,
and long term viability and dividend potential. Lehman analysts produced written
14
research materials including research reports and First Call notes regarding companies
and industry sectors.
15
6. Lehman's research was distributed to both institutional clients and retail investors.
16
Lehman distributed its research product directly to its own client base, comprised of
institutional investors and high net worth individual retail investors. In June 1999,
17
Lehman entered into a ""strategic alliance"" with Fidelity Investments. Among other
things, the ""strategic alliance"" provided Fidelity's retail customers with access to
18
Lehman's research, along with other independent research. Lehman also sold its
research product to other broker-dealers that in turn provided the research to their retail
19
customers. Lehman also made its research available to the public through services
such as Thomson Financial/First Call and Multex.com, Inc. Ratings of Lehman's
20
analysts were freely and publicly available to retail clients through a number of media
outlets.
21
7. At the top of its research reports that were devoted to specific stocks, Lehman
22
assigned to the stock a ""rank"" according to a 5-point scale reflecting how the analyst
believed the stock would perform relative to the market generally. During the period
23
June 1999 through December 2000, Research used the following ratings: 1-Buy
(expected to outperform the market by 15 or more percentage points), 2 - Outperform
24
(expected to outperform the market by 5 -15 percentage points), 3 - Neutral (expected
to perform in line with the market, plus or minus 5 percentage points), 4 - Underperform
25
(expected to underperform the market by 5 - -15 percentage points), 5 - Sell (expected
to underperform the market by 15 or more percentage points). In January 2001,
1
Lehman changed the names of these ratings to 1-Strong Buy, 2- Buy, 3-Market
Perform, 4-Market Underperform and 5-Sell. The definitions remained the same. The
2
definitions for the ratings were provided to Lehman clients on a monthly basis.
Commencing in March 2001, the definitions appeared on all of Lehman's research
3
reports.
4
8. Although Lehman purported to rank stocks according to a 5-point scale, in fact,
during the relevant period Lehman analysts never assigned a 5-Sell rating to a domestic
5
company and almost never assigned a 4-Underperform to a stock.
6
9. Lehman's research reports also assigned to the stock a price target designed to
7
reflect the price at which the analyst believed the stock would trade within a time period
that was identified in some reports and unidentified in others. Commencing in March
8
2001, the relevant time period for the price target appeared in Lehman's research
reports.
9
II.
LEHMAN'S RESEARCH ANALYSTS WERE SUBJECTED TO CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST ARISING FROM LEHMAN'S USE OF RESEARCH TO OBTAIN
10
INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS
11
10. Lehman held out its research analysts as providing independent recommendations
and analysis of companies and stocks upon which investors could rely in reaching
12
investment decisions. Lehman promoted its research for the ""quality and timeliness of
its investment recommendations.""
13
11. In fact, Lehman's research analysts were, at times, subjected to conflicts of interest
14
arising from the close relationship between Research and Investment Banking. Such
conflicts of interest, at times, adversely impacted the independence of Lehman's public
15
stock recommendations.
16
A.
Lehman Used Research To Obtain Investment Banking Business
17
12. Analysts worked closely with members of Investment Banking and other
18
departments to generate business for Lehman. Analysts often worked with Investment
Banking to identify corporate finance opportunities and to win corporate finance
19
business for Lehman, including identifying private companies appropriate for an IPO, as
well as, identifying possible transactions, such as secondary offerings or debt
20
financings, once a company had completed an IPO. To this end, analysts were
expected to have yearly target and alignment meetings with their Investment Banking
21
counterparts.
22
13. Lehman aligned its analysts with an Investment Banking team. Analysts'
responsibilities included providing research to their Investment Banking counterparts so
23
that the bankers could leverage the research product into a full service relationship with
a company.
24
14. Recognizing the strategic importance of this alignment, on August 5, 1999,
25
Lehman's Managing Director of Global Equity Research circulated a memorandum to
Global Research Directors (the ""August 5 Memorandum""), which detailed key areas of
""strategic importance."" The memorandum concluded that in order for Lehman to be
1
more profitable, Investment Banking and Research should work together to increase
Lehman's number of equity originations stating:
2
Investment Banking Partnership - This is a key challenge for not only
research but the entire global equities business. Increasing our equity
3
origination will be one of the most important accomplishments of the
firm. One of the most significant ways we will increase the equity
4
division's total revenue to more than $2 billion is by substantially
increasing origination.
5
15. The August 5 Memorandum also set forth a ""new paradigm"" for Lehman's
6
investment banking relationships stating:
the analyst is THE key driver of the firm relationship with its corporate
7
client base. Analysts need to accept responsibility and use it to
expand the franchise and DRIVE PROFITABILITY EVERY DAY BUT
8
IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH BUILDING A LONG TERM
FRANCHISE. (Emphasis in original.)
9
10
16. The August 5 Memorandum emphasized the research analyst's role in identifying
potential banking business for Lehman stating: ""global research must drive the banking
11
targeting efforts, consistent with the 'new paradigm."" The August 5 memorandum
stated further: ""to ensure we have proper recognition of analysts' impact on banking,
12
we have to closely track every dollar of IBD revenue (equity, M&A, and debt) by
analyst.""
13
17. On September 14, 1999, the Managing Director of Global Equity Research again
14
emphasized the importance of the Investment Banking/Research partnership in a memo
directed to ""Coverage Analysts.' ""Coverage Analysts"" were provided with an attachment
15
dated September 13, 1999 entitled ""1 + 1 = $"" (the ""September 13 Attachment"") that
advised them that the successful partnership of Research and Investment Banking was
16
a key to Lehman's growth as a firm. The first page of the September 13 Attachment
contained a chart reflecting that an ""enhanced Banking/Research partnership"" would
17
strengthen brand perception, increase origination fee share and ultimately lead to a
higher Lehman stock price.
18
18. The September 13 Attachment explained numerous ways in which Lehman
19
Research and Investment Banking could be beneficial to each other and stated that
""seamless Banking/Research coverage"" was critical to all Investment Banking products.
20
The attachment also contained a chart captioned ""Secret to Success -- Lehman Wins
Business When Banking And Research Are Aligned. The September 13 Attachment
21
explained that the Research/Investment Banking partnership at Lehman would be
institutionalized through executive committee support, targeting and alignment, full
22
partnership accountability between bankers and research analysts, and reinforced
through compensation.
23
19. The September 13 Attachment also instructed that bankers and research analysts
24
would be required to complete performance reviews of their counterparts. Research
analysts would be evaluated on, among other things, ""the extent to which the analyst
25
places origination as [a] priority,"" and ""adds value in building banking business,"" and the
analyst's ""effectiveness in [the] pitching process.""
1
20. Finally, the September 13 Attachment explained that Lehman would reinforce the
partnership of Research and Banking through compensation. Analyst compensation
2
would be ""impacted by contribution to banking"" and ""reviewed with appropriate banking
group heads."" The primary criterion in evaluating analyst compensation would be
3
Investment Banking Revenue.
4
21. As part of the relationship between Investment Banking and Research, analysts
often communicated with their Investment Banking counterparts several times a week,
5
or even daily. These communications included identifying banking opportunities for
Lehman. For example, on July 7, 2000, one senior analyst wrote the following email to
6
members of Investment Banking:
FYI, I have recently come across several great companies in the wireless
7
data services industry, an incredibly hot sector for most technology investors.
In my view, we as a firm (tech & telecom) should get all over this sector
8
.I
think we should be very coordinated in attacking this banking windfall.
9
22. In another instance, on September 21, 2000 that same analyst wrote an email to a
10
company to offer research coverage in exchange for naming Lehman as a co-manager
on a deal stating:
11
since the announcement of the Chase/JPM merger, I'm sure you've
come to the same realization that the merger would result in just one
12
firm covering your stock
If
the loss of one analyst is of concern,
was wondering if the opportunity is available to add a jnr (sic) co-
13
manager to ensure same number of coverage analysts.
14
23. Investment bankers at times suggested that analysts issue positive research
coverage on a company to help the bankers win business. Investment bankers would
15
sometimes recommend potential banking clients to Lehman's research analysts.
Lehman's investment bankers understood that if Lehman's research department would
16
cover a potential banking client, this could strengthen Lehman's chances to obtain
banking business from that client. For example, on October 4, 2000 a banker sent the
17
following email to an analyst:
Spoke with [ a Worlstor employee] over at Worlstor. Here's the scoop
18
and what we need to do. They are meeting with other bankers over
the next 4 days
They like [Salomon] because of their research
19
report. Action plan for us includes:
We need to say [Lehman's
analyst] is publishing a big storage ssp report and we would like to
20
make Worlstor the feature of the report like Solly did MSI and
Storagenetworks.
21
[Analyst] you need to call (the CEO) and the CFO at least 3 times
22
between now and the Board meeting
The message is we luv you
and have been waiting for you. [Analyst] your call and enthusiasm is
23
key.
24
24. Another banker wrote the following email to investment bankers and analysts on
June 29, 2000:
25
Our competition on the CPQ debt deal is likely the following
Given
their stock price action after today's downgrade by [SSB], we are the
1
highest equity recommendation. The bottom line is that they need a
very strong story around their credit and we, with [analyst] are in the
2
best position to deliver.'
3
25. Investment bankers also routinely reviewed drafts of analysts' research
reports before publication for several purposes including to insure that the reports
4
were consistent with generating investment banking revenue from the covered
company.
5
B.
Lehman Gave Its Analysts Financial Incentives To Use Research To
6
Generate Investment Banking Revenue
7
26. Lehman tied the compensation of senior research analysts to the amount of
Investment Banking revenue the analyst helped to generate. Lehman analysts typically
8
received relatively small base salaries and considerably larger bonuses. Bonuses were
determined by, among other factors, the amount of Investment Banking revenue
9
generated by companies the analysts covered. The bonuses Lehman paid to analysts
10
dwarfed their base salaries and gave the analysts a strong personal financial incentive
to obtain Investment Banking business. This compensation structure, which in part
11
linked analyst compensation to investment banking business, created conflicts of
interest.
12
1. Certain Analyst Employment Contracts Tied Bonuses
13
Directly To investment Banking Revenue
14
27. Six of Lehman's approximately 100 senior research analysts had employment
contracts that linked their bonuses directly to Investment Banking revenue generated by
15
companies they covered. Depending on the contract, the analyst's entire bonus or an
additional Investment Banking Department (""IBD"") bonus was paid based on the
16
aggregate IBD net revenues and fees generated by companies covered by the analyst
or by companies where the analyst significantly contributed to the Investment Banking
17
business.
18
28. For example, one analyst's contract provided for an annual salary of $200,000, and
a minimum bonus of $4.8 million. The minimum bonus could increase in $1 million
19
increments, based on the Aggregate IBD Net Revenues and Fees for the performance
year as follows:
20
21
Minimum Bonus
Aggregate IBD Net Revenues and Fees
$4.8 million
Less than $50 million
22
$5.8 million
At least $50 million but less than $75
million
23
$6.8 million
At least $75 million but less than $100
million
24
$7.8 million
At least $100 million but less than $125
million
25.
$8.8 million
$125 million or more
1
Aggregate IBD Net Revenues and Fees were defined as revenues and fees booked or
received by Lehman from companies covered by the analyst or from companies whose
2
award of business to Lehman was attributable to the analyst's ""significant contribution.""
3
29. Another analyst's contract provided for the payment of a yearly salary of $200,000,
a minimum bonus of $3.3 million and an additional bonus equal to 5% of Investment
4
Banking revenues and fees generated by companies covered by the analyst or
companies where the analyst substantially contributed to the award of Investment
5
Banking business.
6
2. Lehman Compensated Other Analysts Based In Part On
Their Contribution To Investment Banking Revenue
7
30. Analysts who did not have specific clauses in their contracts related to Investment
8
Banking revenue were nevertheless compensated financially if companies they covered
generated Investment Banking revenue.
9
10
31. The Director of U.S. Equity Research applauded analysts for generating Investment
Banking business. In an email dated January 21, 2001, an analyst described that he
11
had arranged a meeting between Lehman analysts and investment bankers and a large
blue chip company. The analyst explained that his relationship with the company
12
resulted in Investment Banking receiving ten potential projects for the company. The
Director of U.S. Equity Research congratulated the analyst in an email dated January
13
22, 2001 stating ""well done, we need senior bankers to see who (the analysts) have the
real relationships with the big companies. This is how we justify big comp. packages.""
14
32. Lehman also monitored the Investment Banking revenue that analysts generated.
15
For example, Lehman maintained a document titled ""Performance Review"" that, among
other information, kept track of the Investment Banking and trading revenue attributable
16
to each senior analyst. Senior analysts were shown the Performance Review during
their reviews.
17
33. For each analyst, Investment Banking also generated a spreadsheet known as a
18
""Project Review"" that identified Investment Banking projects with revenue booked for
the year and projects expected to generate revenue in the next year. The Director of
19
U.S. Equity Research used the Project Reviews in conducting both mid-year and year-
end evaluations for senior analysts.
20
34. Senior analysts also frequently provided lists of the Investment Banking deals they
21
had worked on during the year to the Director of U.S. Equity Research in connection
with consideration of their year-end bonuses. For example, in December 1999 one
22
senior analyst (who did not have an Investment Banking revenue clause in his contract)
wrote in an email to the Director of U.S. Equity Research that his research
23
accomplishments and banking revenue were relevant to his compensation. In
describing his research accomplishments, the analyst noted that he had written
24
frequently on a company and the company had raised $430 million in equity and high
yield financing through Lehman. The analyst also noted that he had written frequently
25
about another company and, as a result, Lehman was going to appear ""out of order"" on
1
the cover of a convertible deal and had a ""good shot"" at leading an upcoming equity
deal. With respect to banking revenue, the analyst wrote:
2
I believe the revenues generated by my universe generated at least as
3
much as other research universes, excluding the Delta Three IPO
(which RSL's CEO will tell I (sic) was a key part of why LB won the
4
books [Delta Three was covered by another analyst] and for which I
believe I should get credit.
5
35. One Senior analyst sent an email on February 9, 2000 to Lehman's Managing
6
Director of Global Research and the Director of U.S. Equity Research requesting a
promotion to vice president. In support of this request, the analyst wrote, among other
7
things, that the analyst's estimated Investment Banking revenue for the year 2000 was
greater than $5 million and added ""1999 Banking Revenue $1.2M solely due to
8
research relationship.""
9
36. In addition, senior analysts were required to complete business plans each year.
10
The business plan included an entire section devoted to banking and asked analysts to
identify the transactions they are working on or foresee for the coming year. The
11
business plans asked senior analysts to report:
12
their plan to add stocks to coverage for either sales and trading and/or
banking;
13
whether Research/Banking target and alignment discussions were reflected
in the business plan; and
14
whether analysts had completed the selection of ""franchise and super
league clients"" with their bankers.
15
37. Investment bankers participated in analyst evaluations by providing written
16
comments on a form titled ""Year End Performance Review for Analysts (to be
completed by Bankers)"" to the heads of Research. Bankers were asked to evaluate:
17
Whether the analyst places origination as a priority
18
The analyst's contribution toward building relationships with clients in the sector
The analyst's effectiveness in the pitching process
19
The quality of the analyst's reputation with banking clients; and
20
The analyst's level of initiative in providing the banker with value-added ideas for
banking clients.
21
38. The bankers' comments were relayed to analysts during their reviews. For
22
example, one senior analyst's review stated the analyst ""cares a great deal about
competing for business and winning."" Another senior analyst's review stated ""strong
23
originator/rainmaker, ""strong pitchman"" and ""very supportive of banking effort;
coordinate with banking team on targeting major clients.""
24
39. Analysts were also criticized, at times, if they failed to work closely with Investment
25
Banking. For example, in one instance, a senior analyst was encouraged to have more
frequent contact with her Investment Banking counterpart.
1
40. One analyst sent a memorandum dated December 22, 1999 to the Managing
Director of Global Equity Research and the Director of U.S. Equity Research stating that
2
he was ""surprised"" by the review he received from an investment banker (the
""December 22 Memorandum""). As a result, the analyst met with the investment banker
3
in order to receive feedback and ""improve the relationship between research and
investment banking.""
4
-
41. The analyst described his meeting with the banker in the December 22
5
Memorandum stating:
[banker] has concluded, after seeing me for 2-3 months (based on two
6
pitches and other feedback) that I may not have the capabilities to be a
""banking analyst""; i.e., telling companies what they want to hear and
7
not what I think!""
Both parties acknowledge that the Ansell pitch was ineffectual.
8
should not have been there to start with - despite the potential fee!
was told that the bankers working on the pitch were ""upset"" that
I
9
would not present their material Ansell had an inherent growth rate
of
10
0-2% as compared to Merrill's forecast of 10% per annum. A major
fee was ""lost.'
11
42. The analyst also commented that the bankers told him ""that the analysts need to be
12
available at extremely short notice to assist in pitch meetings."" The analyst defended
himself, in part, by commenting that he spent an ""inordinate"" amount of time on other
13
banking prospects.
14
43. Finally, the analyst listed several steps for the future to improve his relationship with
Investment Banking and stated:
15
during my one year tenure at [another bank], we tripled our M&A
business. I created a fundamental research 'halo effect' for ""banking-
16
oriented' analysts. I believe banking could further leverage our sector
research into the VC community (and elsewhere).
17
C. Lehman Used The Promise Of Future Research Coverage To
18
Obtain Investment Banking Business
19
44. .Lehman used the promise of future research coverage to obtain Investment
Banking business. Implicit in Lehman's marketing efforts was the assurance that
20 Lehman's research would be favorable and that Lehman research would raise the price
of the issuer's stock.
21
45. Lehman competed with other investment banks for selection as lead underwriter for
22
securities offerings, including IPOs, secondary offerings and debt offerings. As part of
this competition, Lehman met with companies to present its qualifications. Research
23
analysts sometimes attended these meetings, often referred to as ""pitch"" meetings, with
members of Investment Banking in an effort to win Investment Banking business for
24
Lehman. Lehman research analysts typically advised companies how best to position
and market the company's story to investors.
25
1
46. At such meetings, Lehman often presented companies with marketing materials
known as pitchbooks that touted Lehman's underwriting qualifications. The pitchbooks
2
typically featured the Lehman analyst who would be covering the company after a
banking transaction and stated that the analyst would issue research on the company
3
as soon as the ""quiet period""(a period of time after an offering during which the
underwriting firms cannot publish research) ended. The pitchbooks on occasion
4
provided examples of how coverage by the analyst had been viewed favorably by the
market and had a positive impact on a company's stock price.
5
47. For example, a pitchbook for the Zymogenetics potential IPO promised that the
6
analyst would issue a comprehensive report on the company twenty-five days after
pricing (at the end of the quiet period), would regularly educate investors on the
7
company's story and would publish reports and notes on 'the company on a timely basis.
The pitchbook also promised that Lehman would provide ""pricing, trading and
8
aftermarket support"" by, among other things, providing on-going research coverage.
Under the heading ""Preliminary Terms and Marketing Conditions,"" the pitchbook stated
9
that the analyst would provide ""high quality research support critical to a strong
aftermarket.""
10
11
48. A pitchbook for a Dyax PIPE offering described Lehman's prior research support of
the company following its IPO, noting that Lehman had issued ""8 notes and one
12
extremely comprehensive report on [company], as compared to 5 notes and 1 report by
[co-manager], and 2 notes and 1 report by [co-manager]."" The pitchbook also noted
13
that ""Lehman's Equity Analysts
have been strong supporters of the stock,"" adding
that since the analysts published their research report the stock had increased twenty
14
percent.
15
49. The pitchbooks often noted the analyst's role in marketing the offering. Some
pitchbooks listed research as a term of the underwriting and stated that the ""[analyst]
16
will lead a powerful marketing campaign."" The Zymogenetics pitchbook described the
analyst as the ""preeminent force"" in the biotechnology sector and stated that the analyst
17
has ""outsold other analysts in previous equity offerings,"" and ""outsold the other co-
managers."" Other pitchbooks described the analyst as the ""axe"" in the industry and
18
provided numerous examples of how the analyst's positive coverage had positively
impacted a company's stock price.
19
50. For example, a pitchbook for Yadayada dated November 10, 2000 contained a
20
section entitled ""[Analyst] Moves Markets"" and contained graphs for two companies,
Triton and Alamosa, covered by the analyst. The graph subtitled ""[Analyst] Moves
21
Triton"" demonstrated a decrease in stock price following the analyst's downgrade of
Triton and an increase in the stock price following an upgrade by the analyst. Similarly,
22
the graph subtitled ""[Analyst] Upgrades Alamosa"" shows an increase in Alamosa's stock
price following a voicernail blast by the analyst to clients reiterating the analyst's buy
23
recommendation.
24
51. Similarly, a pitchbook for Texas Instruments dated June 2000 included a graph of
Micron Technology's stock price demonstrating that the stock price increased after the
25
analyst re-initiated coverage and rose again when the analyst raised earnings per share
(""EPS"") targets. The pitchbook also contained a graph of Intel's stock reflecting price
1
increases after the analyst re-initiated coverage and again when the analyst raised the
EPS target. Other pitchbooks contained similar statements about the manner in which
2
the market received Lehman's research.
3
52. The decision whether Lehman would initiate research coverage of a company was
often tied to the opportunity for Lehman to earn Investment Banking fees from the
4
covered company. For example, in February 2000, Lehman bankers questioned a
delay in Lehman initiating research on Curagen Corporation following Lehman's
5
participation in a convertible bond offering by Curagen. The analyst had explained he
needed more time and more meetings with the company before issuing a report. The
6
bankers then questioned the delay in an email to the Director of U.S. Equity Research
who responded that the analyst was doing a great job given his many responsibilities,
7
and asked the bankers:
[W]hen did we decide to promise equity research for a small
8
convertible bond deal. What were the economics & how much did we
make.
9
10
One of the bankers responded to the question stating:
We made $1.5m in banking and Lehman made $12m as of last
11
Thursday. The real question is could we just put a note out that would
satisfy the company and get us in the next deal.
12
53. On another occasion, the Director of U.S. Equity Research received inquiries from
13
Lehman employees on behalf of officers of public companies seeking to have Lehman
initiate research coverage of their company. The Director of U.S. Equity Research
14
responded by directing such inquiries to Investment Banking. For example, in February
2000, the Director of U.S. Equity Research advised a Lehman employee in an email:
15
the proper process is to introduce the principals to someone in
investment banking. If we have the resources and there appears to be
16
significant revenue potential, banking will request research.
17
54. Similarly, in October 1999 the Director of U.S. Equity Research advised another Lehman
employee in an email:
18
doing business is not enough, we need to do a lot of business to
commit resources. Finally, you should find a contact in banking to
19
channel these requests as well.
20
55. In another email in March 2000, an analyst explained to his product manager his
reason for initiating coverage on a stock listed only in Mexico that will be of ""little interest
21
to our US institutional salesforce."" The analyst wrote:
The reason for coverage is there is a potential banking deal (big $$$)
22
we're trying to get later this year. The bankers just want the report out.
They don't care about promoting the stock and realize it is of little
23
interest to my client base.
24
III.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, AT TIMES, RESULTED IN THE PUBLICATION OF
EXAGGERATED OR UNWARRANTED RESEARCH.
25
56. The relationship between Investment Banking and Research as alleged herein at
times created conflicts of interest for Lehman's research analysts. At times, the
1
financial incentives and pressure on analysts to assist in obtaining investment banking
deals and to maintain banking relationships adversely affected the integrity of the
2
analysts' ratings, price targets, and research reports. As the following examples
demonstrate, these conflicts of interest caused analysts, at times, to issue more positive
3
research reports or ratings, and to avoid downgrades or negative reports regarding
companies that were investment banking clients.
4
A.
Razorfish, Inc.
5
57. Lehman co-managed the IPO for Razorfish, Inc. (""Razorfish"") in April 1999. The
6
Razorfish IPO was priced on April 26, 1999 at $16 per share and opened for trading on
April 27, 1999 at $56 per share but ended the day at $35 per share. On May 3, 1999,
7
with Razorfish trading at $37 per share, the Lehman analyst confided to an institutional
investor in emails that he was not sure of the rating and price to assign to the company
8
when he initiated coverage. The institutional investor replied:
unless you anticipate Lehman getting I-business from them, I would
9
rate them neutral with a price target of $20 (especially if you read the
10
last half of the WSJ article on them last week, which pointed out that
their business lacks any real depth)
11
The analyst responded:
12
Well, I they are a banking client so I expect a 2 rating with a price
target just a shade above the trading price
13
58. The institutional investor and the analyst discussed the effect of the conflict of
14
interest on the analyst's research in the following exchange:
Institutional Investor: 1 understand - business is business. But I feel
15
bad for those naïve investors who assume that sell-side analysts are
objective! I wish some buy-side institutions would get together to
16
establish an independent equity research consortium with analysts
paid for on a subscription basis or something
17
Analyst: well, ratings and price targets are fairly meaningless anyway,
18
buy-side generally ignores, commentary is what matters and l'll be a 3-
Neutral in my comments
but, yes, the ""little guy"" who isn't smart
19
about the nuances may get misled, such is the nature of my business.
20
59.
On
May
24,
1999,
with
Razorfish
trading
at
$36,
Lehman
initiated
coverage
of
Razorfish with a 2-Buy rating and a price target of $48.
21
B.
RSL Communications, Inc.
22
60. Lehman had a substantial Investment Banking relationship with RSL
23
Communications, Inc. (""RSL""). Lehman was a joint lead underwriter in a high yield note
placement by RSL in December 1998, provided advisory services in October 1999, was
24
the lead underwriter when RSL spun off Delta Three Communications, Inc. in an IPO in
November 1999 and co-managed two debt offerings for RSL in February 2000. On at
25
least three occasions during 1999-2000, the Lehman analyst covering RSL was ""held
1
off"" from downgrading his analysis of RSL for ""banking reasons."" One of these
instances occurred in February 2000.
2
61. On November 1, 1999, with RSL trading at $21 5/16, the Lehman analyst covering
3
RSL had rated RSL a 1-Buy with a price target of $40. In February 2000, with RSL
trading at $17, the analyst drafted a new report in which lowered his revenue projections
4
for RSL and lowered the price target to $35. The first sentence of the text of the draft
report read ""we are revising our Revenue and EBITDA estimates for RSL to reflect
5
declining revenue from U.S. prepaid and wholesale and a more moderate ramp in
European retail revenue."" Based on his prior experience, the analyst knew that his
6
attempt to express his more negative view of RSL would be resisted by Investment
Banking within Lehman. On February 24, 2000, the analyst sent an email to his
7
supervisor captioned ""RSL Note - Bankers are going to resist"" in which he enclosed his
draft report and stated:
8
Below is a draft of a note lowering our numbers on RSL (maintaining
our 1 rating) Recall we were a co. in their recent convert deal. I've
9
wanted to lower numbers for several months now, but have held back
10
as 1) we led the DeltaThree IPO(was owned by RSL) and more
recently were on the cover of the convert.
I've given our coverage
11
banker the courtesy of seeing this and preparing the company. I know
they are going to resist. I've been quiet on this too long, and I plan
12
on going ahead anyway. [emphasis in original]
13
62. The Lehman investment banker for RSL prevailed on the analyst not to issue the
report and instead to meet with RSL management and to reconsider his analysis. As a
14
result, on March 2, 2000, the analyst issued a report that maintained the $40 price
target. The first sentence of the text of the report touted that ""RSL's European unit
15
posted strong sequential revenue growth in Q4
The analyst issued additional
reports on RSL on March 9 and March 10, 2000, in which he raised the price target to
16
$50.
17
63. On March 16, 2000, the investment banker for RSL sent an email to the analyst's
supervisor praising the analyst's ""open-mindedness"" and crediting the analyst with
18
raising RSL's stock price stating:
1 just wanted to drop you a note to let you know of [analyst's] recent
19
helpfulness in a touchy situation with RSL Communications. RSL is a
telecom company
and is the parent company of Delta 3 for which
20
we recently led an IPO. Following RSL's recent convertible notes
issue (for which we were a co), [analyst] was inclined negatively
21
toward the Company's prospects; however, he agreed to hold off on a
downgrade (which would have harmed an important banking
22
relationship) at the request of banking until he could hear out
management. [Analyst] met with the Company's CEO and was
23
convinced positively, he issued a positive report and was the axe
behind significant positive momentum to the stock. The CEO praised
24
[analyst's] open-mindedness and has indicated we will be included in
the underwritings of their coming spin-offs. Thus, [analyst] has helped
25
our banking relationship with the client significantly.
1
The supervisor forwarded the email to the analyst and wrote ""good job &
congratulations.""
2
64. In May 2000, the analyst issued another report reiterating the 1-Buy rating on the
3
stock and retaining the $50 price target despite the fact that the stock price had declined
to $15.50 per share and the company had missed its revenue estimates.
4
65. By August 14, 2000 RSL's stock price had declined to approximately $4. In an
5
August 14, 2000 email, the analyst candidly complained to his supervisor about the
influence Investment Banking had exerted over his research during the preceding year:
6
Enough is enough. It's hard enough to be right about stocks, it's even
harder to build customer relationships when all your companies blow
7
up, you knew they were going to, and you ,couldn't say anything. Every
single one of my companies has blown up in some fashion (or will -
8
GBLX) and with the exception of PGEX, I haven't been able to speak
my mind. I think I've been a team player, and I believe it is now
9
imperative for the franchise that I be able to take action on bad
situations
10
11
66. The analyst voiced particular concerns about RSL stating ""for the record, I have
attempted to downgrade RSLC THREE times over the last year, but have been held off
12
for banking reasons each time."" (Emphasis in original)
13
67. Even after this complaint, the analyst did not downgrade RSL but rather simply was
permitted to drop coverage in September 2000, devoting a few short sentences to the
14
company in a sector report.
15
C.
DDi Corporation
16
68. A pitchbook for the DDi Corporation (""DDi"") IPO offering described Lehman's highly
regarded research team, listed the analysts' combined years of experience and strong
17
research qualifications and promised research coverage for DDi after the IPO.
18
69. The pitchbook contained an example of the mock research report that the two
Lehman analysts who covered DDi's industry sector would write for DDi, including a
19
graphic of the research report's cover page with a 1-Buy rating.
20
70. DDi opened for trading on April 10, 2000. On June 28, 2000, the analyst whose
name appeared on the mock research report sent an email to the Director of U.S. Equity
21
Research stating that Lehman was a ""co"" on the DDi IPO and that the analyst should
have initiated coverage when the company went public in April but did not due to other
22
demands on his time including the need to cover two banking deals where Lehman was
the lead. The analyst complained that both DDi and Lehman bankers were pushing the
23
analyst to initiate coverage with a 1-Buy rating. The analyst wrote:
Now company DDi and parent (Bain Capital), and bankers are
24
obviously pushing for coverage and unhappy. Problem is that the
shares IPOed at $14 are at $28 today. Bankers want a 1-Buy and are
25
pushing hard. I am concerned that given the current expectations, the
shares could sell off after the quarter is reported in July and could
1
easily drop to $20. I am ready with initiation a FC [First Call] note and
could go out this week, but am not sure how best to deal with this
2
situation. Bankers are not really satisfied with a 2.""
3
71. Despite his misgivings, the analyst initiated coverage of DDi on June 30, 2000 with
a 1-Buy rating and a price target of $36. DDi closed on June 30, 2000 at $28 1/2. On
4
July 31, 2000 DDi closed at $22.
5
D.
RealNetworks, Inc.
6
72. In June 1999, Lehman served as a co-managing underwriter for a secondary
offering of common stock by RealNetworks, Inc. Lehman maintained a 1-Strong Buy
7
rating on the stock from July 1999 through June 2001 despite the fact that the stock lost
approximately 90% of its value falling from a high of $78.59 per share in February 2000
8
to a low of $7.06 in April 2001.
9
73. In the first few days of July 2000, RealNetworks' stock price dropped from $52 per
10
share on July 3, 2000 to $38 per share on July 11, 2000. Lehman issued a research
report on July 11, 2000 responding to what the report described as a weakness in the
11
stock price caused by investor concern over RealNetworks' exposure to online
advertising revenue. The report sought to calm investors' fears by stating that online
12
advertising figures would have ""minimal"" impact on RealNetworks overall revenue. The
report reiterated the 1-Buy rating assigned to the stock and maintained the $150 price
13
target. The report further advised investors that the price weakness presented a buying
opportunity and that Lehman remained ""bullish"" on the stock.
14
74. By July 18, 2000, the stock price had climbed to $56 per share. The analyst issued
15
another research report that again advised investors to ignore concerns about
RealNetworks' exposure to online advertising revenue stating ""we believe recent articles
16
about reductions in online spending is (sic) completely over-hyped - in terms of its
overall impact on RealNetworks."" The report also reiterated the 1-Buy rating assigned
17
to the stock and maintained the $150 price target for the stock.
18
75. On July 19, 2000 the analyst issued a third report commenting on RealNetworks'
second quarter earnings release. The report described the second quarter results as
19
""stellar"" and reiterated the 1-Buy rating assigned to the stock and maintained the $150
price target for the stock.
20
76. Despite the analyst's support for RealNetworks, on July 18, 2000, the analyst
21
advised an institutional investor to short the stock stating ""RNWK has to be a short big
time."" The next morning the institutional investor emailed the analyst ""nice call on rnwk
22
I mean all the upside from crappy ad business
why aren't people jumping up
and down and saying this sucked???
nice call on your part anyhow.""
23
77. The analyst replied: ""we bank these guys so I always have to cut the benefit of the
24
doubt.""
25
78. RealNetworks' stock price continued to fall throughout July 2000 and its price
continued to drop through the end of 2000. By December 2000, RealNetworks had
1
fallen to approximately $12 per share having fallen from its February 2000 high of $78
per share.
2
79. In January 2001, that same analyst wrote to an institutional investor ""if it's in my
3
group it's a short"" despite the fact that the analyst maintained 1-Strong Buy ratings
on
all of his stocks.
4
E.
Broadwing, Inc.
5
80. In January 2001, an analyst was about to initiate coverage of Broadwing, Inc.
6
(""Broadwing""). On January 24, 2001, an investment banker sent an email to the analyst
asking him if Broadwing's numbers were good. The analyst responded that the
7
numbers were ""very much in line."" The banker asked the analyst to raise the price
target. When the analyst questioned the rationale, the banker explained that the
8
increase was necessary to help Lehman win investment banking business.
Banker: any chance of nudging up that price target?
9
10
Analyst: isn't it better for your cause to start conservative, and move up
targets, rather than start high and use up dry powder?
11
Banker: if they are doing a financing and a few points on a price target
12
puts us in line with our competition and, hopefully, helps us get into a
financing, it may be worth considering
13
Analyst: I'm already at $40, I can add a buck or two.
14
Banker: that would be great - MSDW is at 44, CSFB at 46, Mer at 50.
15
Analyst: Done.
16
The next day the analyst issued a research report initiating coverage of Broadwing with
17
a $42 price target.
18
IV.
LEHMAN FAILED TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE RESEARCH ANALYSTS
OR ESTABLISH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THEIR PROPER
19
CONDUCT
20
81. Lehman failed to supervise sufficiently research analysts or establish adequate
policies and procedures to ensure their proper conduct at all times. Lehman had
21
insufficient written procedures to protect the independence of its research analysts and
failed to fully enforce the written procedures it did have.
22
82. Research did not review the propriety of the ratings issued by analysts. For
23
example, Lehman purportedly vetted most of the written research produced by analysts
through the Investment Policy Committee (""IPC"") comprised of six people including the
24
Director of U.S. Equity Research. Written procedures required that an IPC meeting be
held to review initiation of coverage or change of a rating. In fact, at times reports were
25,
reviewed by a single IPC member, who received reports shortly before a meeting.
1
83. Lehman also had inadequate procedures to protect analysts from the pressures
and conflicts of interest resulting from the interaction between research analysts and
2
investment bankers. As alleged above, Lehman permitted pre-publication review of draft
research reports by Investment Banking and by the companies covered in the reports.
3
The Chairman of the IPC and other senior managers in Research also encouraged
analysts to check with banking before changing ratings, downgrading or dropping
4
coverage of a stock.
5
V.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
6
84. Respondent, during the period from July 1999 through June 2001, failed to exercise
diligent supervision over all the securities activities of its associated persons and failed
7
to establish, maintain or enforce written procedures, a copy of which should be kept in
each business office, which set forth the procedures adopted by the dealer, issuer or
8
investment adviser to comply with the listed duties imposed, in violation of AS
45.55.060(b)(1).
9
10
85. Respondent, during the period from July 1999 through June 2001, engaged in acts
or practices that created or maintained inappropriate influences by Investment Banking
11
over Research Analysts, imposed conflicts of interest on its Research Analysts, and
failed to manage these conflicts in an adequate or appropriate manner in violation of
12
just and equitable principles of trade.
13
86. The NASD and NYSE have both established rules governing ethical practices and
conduct. The standards established by the NASD and the NYSE are recognized by the
14
Alaska division as minimum standards of ethical conduct for the purposes of AS
45.55.060(a)(7), relating generally to dishonest or unethical practices in the securities
15
business. During the relevant period, Lehman engaged in acts and practices violative
of:
16
(a) NASD Conduct Rule 2110 requiring members to observe high standards of
17
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade;
18
(b) NYSE Rule 401 requiring that broker dealers shall at all times adhere to the
principles of good business practice and the conduct of his or its business affairs;
19
(c) NYSE Rule 476(a)6 prohibiting the engagement in practices of conduct
20
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade;
21
(d) NASD Conduct Rule 2210(d)1 and 2210(d)2 prohibiting exaggerated or
unwarranted claims in public communications and requiring a reasonable basis for all
22
recommendations made in advertisements and sales literature; and
23
(e) NYSE Rule 472 prohibiting the issuance of communications that contain
exaggerated or unwarranted claims or opinions that lack a reasonable basis. By
24
engaging in the acts and practices described above that created and/or maintained
inappropriate influence by Investment Banking over Research Analysts and therefore
25
imposed conflicts of interest on its Research Analysts, Lehman failed to manage these
conflicts in an adequate or appropriate manner, in violation of AS 45.55.060(a)(7).
1
86. Respondent, during the period from July 1999 through June 2001, issued research
reports, including those for Razorfish, Inc., RSL Communications, Inc., DDI Corp.,
2
RealNetworks, Inc., and Broadwing, Inc., that were not based on principles of fair
dealing and good faith, did not provide sound basis for evaluating facts, were not
3
properly balanced, and/or contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims and opinions of
which there was no reasonable basis, in violation of AS 45.55.060(a)(7).

As a result of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this
8
Order, Lehman Brothers Inc. shall pay a total amount of $80,000,000. This total amount
shall be paid as specified in the SEC Final Judgment as follows:
9
$25,000,000 to the states (50 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto
10
Rico) (Lehman Brothers Inc.'s offer to the state securities regulators hereinafter
11
shall be called the ""state settlement offer""). Upon execution of this Order,
Lehman Brothers Inc. shall pay the sum of $250,000 of this amount to the State
12
of Alaska as a civil monetary penalty pursuant to the agreement of the parties, to
be deposited in the state general fund. The total amount to be paid by Lehman
13
Brothers Inc. to state securities regulators pursuant to the state settlement offer
may be reduced due to the decision of any state securities regulator not to
14
accept the state settlement offer. In the event another state securities regulator
determines not to accept Lehman Brothers Inc.'s state settlement offer, the total
15
amount of the Alaska payment shall not be affected, and shall remain at
$250,000;
16
$25,000,000 as disgorgement of commissions, fees and other monies as
17
specified in the SEC Final Judgment;
18
$25,000,000, to be used for the procurement of independent research, as
described in the SEC Final Judgment;
19
$5,000,000, to be used for investor education, as described in Addendum A,
20
incorporated by reference herein.
21
Lehman Brothers Inc. agrees that it shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly,
22
reimbursement or indemnification, including, but not limited to payment made
pursuant to any insurance policy, with regard to all penalty amounts that Lehman
23
Brothers Inc. shall pay pursuant to this Order or Section Il of the SEC Final
Judgment, regardless of whether such penalty amounts or any part thereof are
24
added to the Distribution Fund Account referred to in the SEC Final Judgment or
otherwise used for the benefit of investors. Lehman Brothers Inc. further agrees
25
that it shall not claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction or tax credit with regard

1
Inc. shall pay pursuant to this Order or Section Il of the SEC Final Judgment,
regardless of whether such penalty amounts or any part thereof are added to the

used for the benefit of investors. Lehman Brothers Inc. understands and
3
acknowledges that these provisions are not intended to imply that Alaska would
agree that any other amounts Lehman Brothers Inc. shall pay pursuant to the
4
SEC Final Judgment may be reimbursed or indemnified (whether pursuant to an
insurance policy or otherwise) under applicable law or may be the basis for any

CONSENT AGREEMENT WITH ROBERT BEANS
7
I. ALLEGATIONS OF FACT
8
1. The Division of Banking, Securities, and Corporations (the division), is responsible
9
for administering the Alaska Securities Act (the Act) at AS 45.55 and regulations adopted
10
under the Act at 3 AAC 08.
11
2. Robert Beans (Beans) is a shareholder of Calista Corporation (Calista) which is
12
organized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and is subject to the
13
requirements of AS 45.55.139 and pertinent regulations due to its having more than 500
14
shareholders and assets exceeding $1,000,000. Beans' mailing address is Post Office Box
15
2426, Bethel, AK 99559.
16
3.
Beans ran in 2003 as an independent candidate for the board of directors of
17
Calista. The statute at AS 45.55.139 requires proxy solicitation materials to be filed with us
18
concurrent with distribution to shareholders. His April 9, 2003 proxy statement was filed
19
with us on April 14, 2003.
20
4. Beans also took out ads in the Delta Discovery newspaper to promote his
21
campaign. We can find no record of these ads, published on April 30, 2003 and May 7,
22
2003, being filed with our division.
23
5. Calista filed a May 22, 2003 complaint alleging that Beans made materially false
24-
and misleading statements in violation of 3 AAC 08.315 in these ads and failed to file them
25
ALASKA ORDER #04-01 S
Page 1
1
with us in violation of AS 45.55.139. A letter was sent to Calista on July 14, 2003 informing
2
it that we did not find that Beans violated 3 AAC 08.315.
3
II. FINDINGS
4
6.
AS 45.55.139 mandates that a copy of all "" materials relating to proxy
5
solicitations be filed with the administrator concurrently with its distribution to
6
shareholders. Beans and Calista do not dispute that the advertisements supporting
7
Beans' proxy campaign were not filed with us.
8
7. The division concludes that Beans violated the Act by not filing a copy of the ads
9
he placed with the Delta Discovery.
10
III. CONSENT AGREEMENT
11
8.
The division finds it in the public interest to settle this matter in an expeditious
12
manner and avoid the costs of a hearing. It hereby enters into this consent agreement
13
under the terms and conditions stated in this agreement.
14
9. Robert Beans, Sr. desires to settle this matter in an expeditious manner and avoid
15
the costs of a hearing. He enters into this consent agreement under the terms and
16
conditions stated in this consent agreement.
17
10. Beans accepts and acknowledges the facts stated in this consent agreement.
18
11. Beans neither admits nor denies the allegation that he violated AS 45.55.139 but
19
enters into this consent agreement in the interest of economy of time and resources.
20
12. Under AS 45.55.920(a)(1)(A), Beans agrees to cease and desist from the
21
activities described in this consent agreement that the Division asserts are violations of the
22
Alaska Securities Act and regulations. He also agrees to cease and desist from any future
23
conduct that would violate any provision of the Act.
24
13. Under AS 45.55.920(c), Beans agrees to pay $100 to the division towards the
25
costs of its investigation. Of this amount, $50 is suspended until Beans becomes a
ALASKA ORDER #04-01 S
Page 2
1
respondent under a future order by this division.
2
14. Respondent Beans knowingly waives his right for an opportunity to a hearing with
3
respect to this consent agreement.
4
15. The division agrees that this consent agreement is a final settlement of Beans'
5
liability under the Act and its regulations for civil penalties relating to his proxy solicitations
6
as alleged in this consent agreement.
7
16. This consent agreement shall remain in full force and effect and binding until it is

FINAL ORDER
10
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
11
1. The Division of Banking, Securities, and Corporations (division), is respons-
12
ible for administering the Alaska Securities Act (Act) at AS 45.55 and regulations adopted
13
under the Act at 3 AAC 08.
14
2. Lotus Management (Lotus) operates as a sole proprietorship and is reportedly
15
affiliated with Global Strategies Ltd. Lotus is purportedly an investment advisory service
16
with offices located at 1110 S. Alma School Road, Suite #5-240, Mesa, Arizona 85210 and
17
at 550 W. Baseline Road, Ste #102-240, Mesa, Arizona 85210. The telephone numbers
18
given for Lotus, 651-776-1847 and 651-776-1965, have the area code and prefix of being
19
located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Bud Riley (Riley) is listed as the main sales person and
20
Loren Poole (Poole) as his assistant.
21
3. In October 2001, the division received a complaint from Alaska resident DS.
22
The complaint prompted an investigation that raised issues of failure to register or exempt
23
the security, sales by an unregistered agent, failure to provide appropriate offering
24
materials, and other alleged defects.
25
ALASKA ORDER # 03-10 S
Page 1
IH
1
4. In February 2000, Riley contacted DS by telephone about investing in various
2
programs through Lotus. On March 1, 2000, DS invested $4,990 in a program offered by
3
Lotus that had a 3-month term and promised a profit of 33%. The total due to DS at the
4
end of the term of the program, principal and interest, was to be $6,636. DS sent his initial
5
investment via FedEx on March 1, 2000 in the form of a cashier's check to the address
6
located on Alma School Road in Mesa, AZ as instructed by Riley,
7
5. On June 1, 2000, at the end of the 90-day program, DS instead of with-
8
drawing any funds in the program, had them transferred into another project offered by
9
Lotus known as the ""Gilbralter"" [sic] Project. DS added an additional $3,364 to make his
10
total investment as of that date $10,000. The ""Gilbralter"" Project had a term of 12 months
11
with a profit of 80% ($8,000) that was to be paid every 4 months for a total profit of
12
$24,000. On June 1, 2000, DS sent this additional investment, also in the form of a
13
cashier's check via FedEx, to the address on Baseline Road in Mesa, AZ, as instructed by
14
Riley.
15
6. In June and July 2000, DS telephoned Riley and Poole and was advised that
16
more investors were needed for the project and they wanted DS to help them find more. In
17
September of 2000, DS telephoned Poole and requested that his investment be refunded.
18
Poole told DS that a 12-month contract had been signed and that DS would not be able to
19
get a refund until after June 6, 2001.
20
7. Since June 6, 2001, DS has attempted on several occasions to contact either
21
Riley or Poole but has had no success. DS left messages on the answering machine at the
22
provided telephone numbers, but none of the calls has been returned.
23
8. As of the date of this order, DS has not received any interest or return of
24
principal from the investment.
25
9. DS asserts that at no time were a complete set of offering materials proffered,
ALASKA ORDER # 03-10 S
Page 2
IH
1
either prior to or after the sale. Forms for the investments, however, were received.
2
10. As a result of the investigation, the division was able to determine that the
3
funds invested by DS were deposited into the bank account of Lotus Management in Mesa
4
Arizona, which is owned by and solely under the control of Cheryl A. Boos (Boos). The
5
account was opened on November 4, 1999 by Boos under the name of Cheryl A. Boos,
6
d/b/a Lotus Management. According to documentation filed with the Bank of America,
7
Boos had sole control over the dissemination of any and all funds deposited into that
8
account. The investigation further revealed the following addresses for Boos: 1) P.O. Box
9
40221, Mesa, AZ 85274; 2) 829 N. Poplar Court, Chandler, AZ 85226; and, 3) 900 W.
10
Grove Parkway, Tempe, AZ 85283.
11
11. During the investigation, the division attempted to contact Riley and Poole at
12
the telephone numbers that had been used by DS. Several messages were left on the
13
answering machine at those numbers and as of the date of this order no one has returned
14
those messages. The division also sent a letter to Lotus Management at its last known
15
address of 550 W. Baseline Road, Mesa, AZ. The letter was returned marked ""Return to
16
Sender Not at this Address.""
17
12. The Act at AS 45.55.030 requires persons transacting business in Alaska as
18
a broker-dealer or agent be registered or exempted from registration under the Act.
19
13. The division reviewed records maintained at the division and with the Central
20
Registration Depository (CRD) and did not find any Alaskan registration as a broker-dealer
21
or agent of the issuer for Riley, Poole, or Boos.
22
14. The division reviewed its files and did not find any Alaska registration or
23
exemption for the issuer's securities.
24
15. After numerous attempts, Respondent Cheryl Boos was served by certified
25
mail on May 30, 2003. To date, she has not responded in any way and has failed to
ALASKA ORDER # 03-10 S
Page 3
IH
1
request a hearing within the 15-day period as specified in AS 45.55.920(d), therefore this
2
final order is warranted.
3
FINDINGS
4
16. The definition of a security at AS 45.55.990(32) includes, among other
5
things, ""participation in any profit-sharing agreement; limited liability company interest
6
under AS 10.50,"" and an investment contract. The Alaskan investor made a capital
7
contribution to Lotus to participate in the programs/projects recommended by Riley and
8
Poole. The U.S. Supreme Court in Securities & Exchg. Comm'n V. W.J. Howey Co., 328
9
U.S. 293, 299, 66S.Ct. 1100, 1103 (1946), enunciated the definition of investment contract
10
as ""a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests money in a common
11
enterprise and is led to expect profit solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.'
""
12
The division finds that this case involved an investment contract.
13
17. The division finds that Riley, Poole, and Boos violated AS 45.55.030 by
14
transacting business in Alaska as broker-dealers or agents without registration.
15
18. The division finds that all of the Respondents violated AS 45.55.070 by
16
selling securities that were not registered, exempted, or federal covered securities.
17
19. The division finds that by holding themselves out as investment advisers, the
18 Respondents indicate they are familiar with securities laws and, therefore, they acted with
19
knowledge.
20
LAW
21
See Appendix ""A"" attached and incorporated by reference for a recitation of the
22
statutes and regulations cited in this Order.
23
ORDER AND NOTICE
24
20. Under AS 45.55.920(a)(1), the Administrator finds that the Respondents
25
engaged in violations of the Alaska Securities Act as specified above and further finds it is

21. Under AS 45.55.920(a)(1)(A), the Respondents are ordered to cease and
3
desist from the acts cited above and from any future acts that would violate the Alaska
4
Securities Act.
5
22. Under AS 45.55.920(b), each of the Respondents is liable to pay a fine of

WHEREAS, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (""Goldman Sachs"") is a broker-dealer registered in the
10
State of Alaska; and
11
12
WHEREAS, coordinated investigations into Goldman Sachs's activities in connection with its
potential conflicts of interest by research analysts, the issuance of research that might have lacked
13
objectivity, and potentially improper sharing of research information with public companies and the
investment banking division of the firm during the period of approximately 1999 through 2001
14
(""Relevant Period"") have been conducted by a multi-state task force and a joint task force of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, and the National
15
Association of Securities Dealers (collectively, the ""regulators""); and
16
WHEREAS, Goldman Sachs has cooperated with regulators conducting the investigations
17
by responding to inquiries, providing documentary evidence and other materials, and providing
regulators with access to facts relating to the investigations; and
18
WHEREAS, Goldman Sachs has advised regulators of its agreement to resolve the
19

20
WHEREAS, Goldman Sachs agrees to implement certain changes with respect to its
21
research practices, and to make certain payments; and
22
WHEREAS, Goldman Sachs elects permanently to waive any right to a hearing and appeal
23
under the Alaska Securities Act (Act) (AS 145.55.935) with respect to this Administrative Consent
Order (the ""Order"");
24
NOW THEREFORE, the Alaska Securities Administrator, as administrator of the Act, hereby
25
enters this Order:
1
JURISDICTION/CONSENT
2
Goldman Sachs admits the jurisdiction of the division of banking, securities, and
corporations (division), neither admits nor denies the findings of fact and conclusions of law
3
contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by the division.
4
FINDINGS OF FACT
5
1.
As set forth in greater detail herein, in general, during the Relevant Period, certain of the
procedures and processes in place to insulate Goldman Sachs's equity research analysts
6
(hereafter ""analysts"" or ""research analysts"") from pressures and influences from covered
companies or investment banking were not sufficient. Also, in general, during the Relevant
Period, in some respects Goldman Sachs failed to exercise reasonable supervision so as to
7
ensure that, in the context of the procedures and processes in place, its research analysts
were sufficiently insulated from pressures and influences from covered companies or
8
investment banking.
9
2.
Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking and securities firm that, among other
things, offers underwriting services to companies seeking to sell their securities to the public
10
In addition to its prominent investment banking operations, Goldman Sachs also offers
extensive services to its institutional investor clients and its private wealth management
11
clients (principally high net worth individuals), has an active securities sales and trading
business, and maintains a separate division to perform research on equity securities.
12
3.
For the companies for which Goldman Sachs provides equity research coverage, Goldman
13
Sachs analysts issue periodic reports and make investment recommendations. During the
Relevant Period, Goldman Sachs's equity research ratings included four investment ratings:
14
Recommended List - expected to provide price gains of at least 10 percentage
points greater than the market over the next 6-18 months;
15
Market Outperformer - expected to provide price gains of at least 5-10 percentage
16
points greater than the market over the next 6-18 months;
17
Market Performer - expected to provide price gains similar to the market over the
next 6-18 months; and
18
Market Underperformer - expected to provide price gains of at least 5 percentage
19
points less than the market over the next 6-18 months.
20
In addition, Goldman Sachs had one shorter-term rating:
21
Trading Buy - expected to provide price gains of at least 20 percentage points
sometime in the next 6-9 months.
22
4.
In addition to ratings, the research reports generally contained Goldman Sachs's analysis of
23
the covered company's financial prospects.
24
A.
INVESTMENT BANKING DIVISION'S RELATIONSHIP TO AND INFLUENCE ON
25
RESEARCH DIVISION.
1
Portrayal of Research
2
5.
Goldman Sachs held itself out as generating and providing research reports that were the
3
product of objective research and the opinions of the firm's research division. During the
Relevant Period, Goldman Sachs disclosed various conflicts of interest-related disclaimers
4
in its research reports, including investment banking relationships with covered companies.
6.
The research reports and ratings of companies covered by Goldman Sachs analysts as well
5
as Goldman Sachs's list of recommended stocks were made available to Goldman Sachs's
institutional investor clients and its private wealth management clients, principally high-net
6
worth individuals. On occasion, the substance of Goldman Sachs's research reports, in
whole or in part also was reported in the U.S. financial news media.
7
8
7.
Goldman Sachs's equity research included formal, so-called ""blue-stripe"" reports, notes, and
comments.
9
8.
Goldman Sachs's research or the content of its research was disseminated by various
10
means, including: by mail, via facsimile, distributions at client meetings, via e-mail, via
Goldman Sachs's research Website for clients, telephone conversations by analysts and
11
salespersons, and as part of analysts' appearances on television, at seminars, and at
industry conferences.
12
9.
The 2002 mission statement by Goldman Sachs's U.S. research department was: ""Regain
13
our pre-eminent status through independent, high-quality, differentiated product and
service.""
14
Research analyst assistance to investment banking.
15
10.
During the Relevant Period, research coverage by analysts (including at Goldman Sachs)
was a factor many issuers took into account in awarding investment banking business. The
16
reputation of Goldman Sachs's analysts was sometimes a factor in winning investment
banking business from certain issuers. Goldman Sachs's use of its research analysts for
17
investment banking business went beyond simply relying on the reputation of its analysts;
Goldman Sachs's research analysts assisted in evaluating and marketing certain investment
18
banking business.
19
11.
Frank Governali, co-head of Goldman Sachs's research for the telecommunications sector,
joined Goldman Sachs in mid-1999. In January 2000, he e-mailed a former colleague at
20
another investment bank: ""It's been a good first 6 months, and its [sic] been very busy.
There has not been a day when we're not involved with some deal, so I'm learning a lot
21
more about that side of the business than I experienced at [the other investment bank].""
22
""Research alignment"" process
23
12.
In connection with making coverage decisions in the context of limited resources, Goldman
Sachs implemented a Research Alignment process whereby the Investment Banking
24
Division, the Equities Division, and the Research Division ""work collaboratively to insure a
strategic alignment of [Goldman Sachs's] business - that the biggest opportunities for
investment banking and equities were being covered, that [Goldman Sachs] had the right
25
Research resources in the right places, and that [Goldman Sachs's] Research reputation for
independent and thoughtful analysis was sustained if not enhanced."" In the context of
1
Investment Banking, Research Alignment ""insur(es] that companies of strategic and/or
commercial importance to both IBD and Research are covered by an analyst and a banking
2
team.
[I]deal candidates for coverage are those that are franchise defining, and/or those
that offer a meaningful opportunity for significant revenue in the relatively near term.""
3
13.
Sector captains were appointed within investment banking to ""coordinate all banker requests
4
for Research coverage; work with IBD teams and ECM [Equity Capital Markets] to establish
priority rankings within the sector and reach consensus with Research counterparts.""
5
14.
A January 2001 research retreat reminded analysts that investment banking sector captains
were to ""[w]ork directly with Research counterparts to agree on names and timing"" of
6
companies to be covered and to ""[d]etermine IBD priority ranking of each company needing
Research, including rationale and timing.""

Representatives of investment banking and research met periodically to review companies
8
that were candidates for research coverage. In May 2000, the heads of research reported:
""Of the 63 companies highlighted which offered equity opportunities over the next 12 months
9
or which were SuperLeague targets, 40 are now considered no longer active, 9 have been
picked up by Research, and 14 still need coverage, based on recent banker input
10
16.
The Research Alignment process was designed to ensure that the various interested areas
11
of the firm (including Investment Banking and Equities) had effective input into which issuers
to cover and when to initiate coverage. Goldman Sachs states that the research alignment
did not dictate the substance of research.
12
Goldman Sachs's compensation structure and employee performance review system
13
17.
As with all professional employees of the firm, analyst compensation consisted of a salary
14
and a discretionary bonus. Analyst compensation at Goldman Sachs was based on many
factors, including, among other things, the level of compensation that analysts could
15
command in the market for their particular industry or sector specialty - which might be
impacted by the level of investment banking activity in that sector - whether an analyst was
16
ranked in broker polls, Greenwich Survey, Institutional Investor, and performance reviews -
which, as discussed below, often made reference to contributions to investment banking.
17
Analysts received no formulaic or other compensation with respect to specific investment
banking projects. Comments in some employee evaluations indicated that some analysts
18
were involved in many aspects of investment banking-related activities and reflected certain
employees' beliefs that participating or assisting in investment banking activities was a
19
factor in measuring the analyst's performance.
20
18.
Goldman Sachs introduced a new program in June 2000 to strengthen ""firmwide marketing .
including how we leverage our brand, advertise, and in particular, cross-sell
21
Strengthening cross-selling efforts was defined as a ""top strategic priority for 2000."" A
$50,000 award was created to recognize individuals across all divisions of the firm who
""cross-sell or help deliver a significant mandate to another business unit or division.""
22
19.
Goldman Sachs explored and took steps toward the development of a potential ""Analyst
23
Scorecard"" in 2001, to measure the success of analysts' work, including ""client contact and
revenue generation,"" and ""the analyst's involvement with IBD transactions, and associated
24
fees [to be earned by Goldman Sachs)."" In connection with this process, Goldman Sachs
created spreadsheets, for each analyst, listing the number of investment transactions in
25
which the analyst was involved and the total value of investment banking fees involved in
those transactions. Goldman Sachs determined not to implement the Analyst Scorecard.
Had Goldman Sachs decided to implement the Analyst Scorecard, the investment banking
1
deals with the largest estimated revenues to Goldman Sachs would have resulted in higher
scores on the Analyst Scorecard.
2
20.
In February 2002, Goldman Sachs introduced its Research Pentathlon. There were five
3
areas being measured: polls, stock picking, commercial, reviews, and culture. As part of the
commercial measurement: ""analysts [were] measured according to their banking and trading
4
activity."" Each analyst was required to identify those ""announced or closed banking
transactions in your sector that took place"" during the prior period. For example, in a
February 15, 2002 e-mail, an analyst was told to indicate whether he had ""Introduced Senior
5
Management to GS Banking, ""Attended Pitch,"" or ""Led Sales Call,"" and to ""rate the scale of
your overall involvement"" ranging from minimal to critical.
6
21.
All Goldman Sachs employees, including analysts, were evaluated as part of the firmwide
7
""360 degree"" review process. During the Relevant Period, analysts, like all other employees
at the firm, were evaluated not only by supervisors, peers, and subordinates in the research
8
division, but also by employees in other divisions and departments of the firm with whom the
analyst had worked, including to varying extents investment banking and equity sales and
9
trading. The evaluations that employees submitted during the 360 degree review process
generally were anonymous. In most cases, even the analyst's supervisor who orally
10
delivered the year-end review to the analyst did not know the identities of the employees
who made comments about the analyst. The specific comments in the 360 degree reviews
11
were not shown to analysts but certain comments may have been discussed or described in
some cases. Rather, after reading all of the 360 degree reviews, reviewing other indicators
12
of performance and taking into account his or her own assessment of the analyst's
performance, the analyst's supervisor would provide an overall assessment of the analyst's
13
performance.
Comments about analysts in the 360 degree review
14
22.
Some employee evaluations referred to investment banking revenues on transactions in
15
which the analyst had a role and to the fact that analysts might be involved in many aspects
of investment banking.
16
a.
For example, one employee commented that an analyst was: ""Very hard working,
17
focused and eager to do a good job and win business."" He said the analyst was
""Becoming much more proactive about sharing info with banking. A good team
18
player and very cooperative. Well focused on banking issues and GS [Goldman
Sachs] business overall."" Another evaluation of the same analyst commented that:
19
""He is a great help to the Banking franchise. Always willing to impart his expertise
and seems happy to take the time to explain complex strategic and positioning
20
issues."" A different evaluation of this analyst stated: ""[Analyst] takes a high level of
pride in his analysis and work, and has put out a number of carefully researched and
21
well-written pieces which are definitely value-added to clients.""
b.
An evaluation of another analyst stated: ""She did a super job with the IB client as
22
well as investors on the Coinstar CSO.
She became more comfortable over time
that IB fee-paying potential should be a consideration in her list [of companies to
23
cover]. Though [analyst] worked closely with IB putting her initial list together,
[analyst] is fairly (sometimes fiercely) independent. I strongly suggest that she use
24
the resources that IB offers as she works evaluating companies (e.g. when changing
her [financial] model, please inform/consult the IB team).""
25
1
c.
A comment about one analyst stated: ""Hard to say how much of poor investment
decisions have been because banking drove the outcome."" Another comment about
2
the same analyst said: ""[Analyst] has a very high integrity in her work.""
3
d.
An evaluation of Frank Governali stated: ""Frank is swamped and needs help. The
demands placed upon him by his banking duties threatens the very franchise that
has allowed him to become such a powerful banking asset. Frank is a very good
4
analyst who is thoughtful, user friendly, creative and totally inaccessible."" Another
evaluation of Governali stated ""his overall integrity is a strong feature.""
5
e.
An evaluation of another analyst stated: ""There are still times when [analyst] does
6
not think commercially about a client. There have been times when [analyst] is going
to see an important CEO target and no one from banking is even aware that he has
7
the meeting."" Another comment about the same analyst said: ""His analysis is
considered very objective and is widely used by clients.""
8
Performance evaluations influenced compensation
9
23.
Training for new analysts taught that their performance evaluation criteria included
10
""Revenue production
[and] 360° feedback from IBD bankers.""
11
Analyst business plans
12
24.
During the Relevant Period, analysts were required to develop business plans that
discussed a broad range of areas such as what the analyst's plans were for Global
Research with respect to both products and services, what major investment themes the
13
analyst would develop relating to his or her coverage universe, and what investor
conferences the analyst had planned. One of the many such categories covered by the
14
business plans was how the analyst planned to assist the investment banking efforts of the
firm. As noted below, the business plans included questions that implied that the research
15
analysts' contribution to the firm's investment banking business plan was part of their job.
Business plan forms asked analysts to explain, among other things:
16
a.
""How much of your time will be devoted to IBD?""
17
b.
""Are you using/managing IBD effectively? How can you work more effectively with
18
IBD to exploit the opportunities available to the firm? What specific opportunities do
you see? Do you have alignment - do you have counterparts in IBD you work with to
19
approach business in an integrated fashion? How can IBD help you in conferences,
client meetings, etc?""
20
c.
""What stocks do you plan to add at current team size?
Have you discussed this
21
coverage with relevant IBD, Equities and other users?""
d.
""With which corporates do you have a better relationship with senior management
22
than IBD does? How will you use that to enhance GS business opportunities?""
23
25.
Analyst responses included:
24
a.
In response to the question: ""What are the three most important goals for you in
2000?"" one analyst replied: ""1. Get more investment banking revenue. 2. Get more
25
investment banking revenue. 3. Get more investment banking revenue.""
b.
Another analyst commented: ""My two most important company specific research
1
reports in 2000 will likely be the initiation of coverage reports of the two Latin
American e-Finance companies that we may IPO this year."" [An IPO is an initial
2
public offering.]
3
c.
An analyst expressed the view that ""flexible/opportunistic research can be a big
business driver for GS."" In discussing ""Lessons Learned,"" the analyst also stated
4
that: ""Reputational issues surrounding this business demand that we properly
manage it"" including ""Independence of Research.""
5
d.
In response to the question of which firms present the toughest competition to an
analyst and what the competition does better, one analyst remarked about the firm
6
Sanford Bernstein: ""Bernstein also gives us a run because they have equivalent
manpower to what we have, but they cover only about half as many stocks and
7
don[']t have any banking business. We just have an incredibly difficult time beating
the thought leadership these guys are able to put back on the table as a result of that
8
focus.""
9
Analysts' assistance to investment banking.
10
26.
An August 2001 presentation to managers of the research division on Research Alignment
states: ""The individual company coverage provided by Global Investment Research helps
11
drive the majority of the firm's largest businesses, from winning financing deals and advisory
business to obtaining orders in the secondary market."" The presentation also states: ""the
12
Research Alignment process was developed with the goal of quantifying, at the individual
company, industry and sector levels, the available revenue opportunities to Goldman Sachs
13
on both the Equities (trading) and IBD (equity issuance, high yield issuance and M&A) sides
of the business."" On the investment banking side, this assistance included, among other
14
things, identifying potential investment banking opportunities, assisting in pitching
investment banking business, and assisting in selling securities being underwritten by
Goldman Sachs.
15
27.
Analysts assisted investment banking at the firm by using their knowledge of particular
16
industry sectors and companies within those sectors to identify potential investment banking
opportunities.
17
28.
An analyst wrote to an investment banker, wanting to ""harmonize with you strategically"" to
18
pursue an investment banking opportunity with one of the companies in the technology
sector that the Research Division wanted to cover. The analyst suggested offering research
19
coverage of the issuer to be in a position to obtain investment banking business.
20
29.
A widely distributed 2001 e-mail discussed ""an Internal Use Only report for Investment
Banking in the Americas highlighting Research views on potential investment banking
21
activity in each sector."" The ""report will provide our bankers with a record of our ideas, and
credit when our prescience leads to a transaction.""
22
30.
In October 1999, an analyst sent an e-mail thanking equity salespeople and private wealth
23
management representatives at Goldman Sachs for arranging investors for a non-deal
roadshow for company management to present a potential share repurchase to potential
investors. The day after the roadshow was completed, the company awarded Goldman
24
Sachs a mandate to repurchase 5% of the company's outstanding stock. The analyst told
the salespeople and private wealth management representatives: ""your efforts have already
25
borne positive fruit"" because ""Goldman Sachs received the mandate for [this share
repurchase] as a direct reward for the work you all did.""
1
2
Assistance in making pitches.
3
31.
In an April 20, 2000 e-mail, an investment banker told two analysts at the firm that in
preparation for an investment banking pitch to a potential issuer [Loudcloud], that the
4
company suggested that the analysts ""come prepared to SELL."" The banker proposed that
part of the pitch include a draft research report on the potential issuer so that Goldman
5
Sachs could say ""we are so excited about the story that we have already begun writing the
report."" The analyst predicted to the investment bankers: ""WE WILL WIN THIS
MANDATE!!!""
6
32.
Frank Governali was credited by a Goldman Sachs banker as the determining factor in
7
winning an early 2000 IPO for a foreign issuer: ""Frank was fully involved in pitching this and
thanks to him, we received a sole-book mandate with Joint lead of [another investment
8
bank]."" Moreover, the banker told other analysts ""your input will be critical to the success of
this IPO.""
9
Assistance in explaining and marketing IPOs to institutional investor clients
10
33.
Analysts often assisted in marketing the securities to be sold in an IPO. One issuer's ""Lead
11
Banker Selection Criteria"" stated: ""Need to understand commitment of senior analysts that
they will be the 'lead' research analyst on the deal and in the aftermarket."" This
12
""commitment"" was understood to include the following with respect to analysts:
13
a.
""Spending time personally with the CFO to refine the financial model and define
appropriate IPO and ongoing business metrics.""
14
b.
Assisting with the roadshow presentation.
15
c.
""They personally will pro-actively market [the issuer] to the institutional community
and be available on a regular basis to respond to institutional investor questions.'
16
34.
A March 2001 pitchbook stated: ""Leverage the role of research in marketing the [issuer's)
17
story.'
18
35.
An analyst commented about an issuer: ""I have been out aggressively telling the story, and
the volume has picked up noticeably."" The issuer's stock had moved from $50 on August 2,
19
2000 to over $60 on August 25, 2000, the day of this e-mail.
20
36.
Responding to complaints by a potential issuer about a downgrade of the sector, an analyst
told the potential issuer: ""Both [analyst] and I continue to view the [potential issuer] offering
21
in these difficult markets [as] our highest priority, and remain committed to doing everything
we can to get us to a successful outcome over the coming days and beyond.
We
22
continue to use every opportunity including client discussions of the macro environment to
highlight [potential issuer's) short and long-term differentiation against a lot of the public
23
models."" The analyst closed by saying: ""Again, I want to stress that both [analyst] and I
remain committed to the short and long-term success of [potential issuer].""
24
The time and effort expended by analysts to assist investment banking efforts
varied
25
37.
In self-reported time estimates for 2000, one analyst estimated he spent 40% of his time on
1
investment banking-related activities while another analyst estimated his investment
banking-related activities consumed 55% of his time.
2
38.
Business plans prepared by analysts included an estimate of how much of the analyst's time
3
not devoted to Research would be devoted to each of four divisions of the firm, including -
Investment Banking and Equities. In 1999, different analysts estimated they would spend
between 5% and 75% of their non-Research time on Investment Banking, which included all
4
merger and acquisition and financing activities (dividing 100% of their non-Research time
among the four divisions listed in the question).
5
Research alignment effectiveness
6
39.
Goldman Sachs's ""Global Investment Research IBD Alignment Process"" was summarized
7
as follows in 2000: ""US Investment Research appears to be on the right track with our IBD
alignment initiative.""
8
a.
""[R]esearch analysts, on 429 different occasions, solicited 328 transactions in the
9
first 5 1/2 months of this fiscal year.""
10
b.
""Research was involved in 82% of all 'won business' solicitations.""
11
C.
""Research was involved in 49% of 'lost business' solicitations.""
12
d.
""Only 4.3% of all IBD 'lost business' was attributed to lack of research coverage.""
e.
""IR [Investment Research] was involved in 31 mergers amounting to $56 billion.""
13
f.
""IR was involved in 209 financing transactions not reported in MarketView amounting
14
to $83 billion.""
15
g.
""In addition to financings, US IR was involved in a significant number of merger
advisories, solicitations, and other transactions which have either not yet closed or
16
were not captured [in the] database.""
17
Influences of investment banking personnel on research and the timing of
research coverage
18
40.
In at least some instances, analysts sent drafts of research reports to investment banking
19
before publicizing them. An advance copy of changes to a research report was sent to two
employees in the investment banking division for their comments ""to speed up the approval
20
process.""
41.
21
One analyst stated in a business plan: ""Since our banking ties are so close to each one of
the companies mentioned above along with the fact that these companies are direct
competitors with each other, it is incredibly difficult to voice strong opinions in these sectors.'
22
42.
In early 2000, Goldman Sachs investment banking client ""Ask Jeeves"" expressed concern
23
that Goldman Sachs had yet to initiate research coverage on the issuer. The issuer e-
mailed Goldman Sachs's investment banker saying its stock was ""dropping like a rock,"" and
24
stating: ""Our hopes were that a buy coverage from our lead banker might help stabilize the
stock."" Goldman Sachs's investment bankers complained to analysts who stated that ""[w]ith
25
research commitment committee approval and an improvement in the market, research
coverage is imminent.""
1
Discussion of research capabilities in Goldman Sachs pitchbooks
2
43.
Some Goldman Sachs investment banking pitches included a discussion of the benefits the
issuers would receive from Goldman Sachs research. In some cases, this included
3
reference to Goldman Sachs research ratings for other companies covered by Goldman
Sachs analysts.
4
Examples of pitches featuring the roles of analysts
5
44.
An October 2000 pitchbook for GeneProt explained the ""[r]ole of investment research
analyst,"" as ""creating the story
marketing the story
[and] following the story."" A
6
pitchbook for MFS Investment Management included a list of the various ratings provided by
the analyst on the companies he covered, stated a ""[g]lobal sales effort led by analysts,"" and
7
contained a diagram of the role of analysts in an initial public offering.
8
45.
A July 2000 pitchbook to Crown Castle said ""Goldman Sachs has been a constant bull on
the tower sector"" and stated the fact that ""Goldman Sachs has placed Crown Castle on our
9
Recommended List, our Firm's highest investment rating.""
10
46.
Another pitchbook said: ""[Goldman Sachs analyst] has sold more stock than any research
analyst in the sector."" The pitchbook provided a list of other companies covered by the
11
analyst - none had a ""Market Underperformer"" rating, eight had Market Performer ratings,
four were listed as Market Outperformers, and five were on the firm's Recommended List.
12
Goldman Sachs's investment bankers had input into research coverage
decisions.
13
47.
Investment banking and equities personnel had input into decisions regarding the initiation
14
and termination of research coverage for certain issuers.
15
48.
On July 12, 2000, Goldman Sachs assigned a Market Outperformer rating for RSL
Communications. By October 11, 2000, the stock had dropped below $1.50 so the analyst
16
sent an e-mail to Frank Governali asking when Goldman Sachs could drop coverage of
RSLC. Governali responded: ""Good que l'll Call the bankers soon and ask their
17
view.""
18
49.
An investment banker informed an analyst in 2000 that the head of research had approved
""dropping coverage of Olympic Steel (ZEUS) and Birmingham Steel (BIR).""
19
50.
In September 1999, an investment banker sent an e-mail to an analyst stating: ""Our list for
20
you to publish on from the IBD front is (in order):
Five issuers were then listed (four of
which were investment banking prospects).
21
51.
A 360 degree review of one analyst stated: ""Initiated coverage of [two examples cited]
22
promptly after being co-manager on the initial public offering. NOT picking up coverage of
[another company] as the company stiff-armed IBD when selecting underwriters.""
23
52.
In another 360 degree review of an analyst, an investment banker stated: ""we have probably
pushed her into research on companies where maybe she shouldn't have been or we did
24
not have the client firmly commit[ed] enough on business before she covered them.""
25
53.
In 2001 an investment banker attempted ""to squeeze [an analyst] about accelerating the
time frame for picking up [coverage on Time Warner Telecom].""
1
Analyst discussions about research.
2
54.
In March 2001, an analyst told her supervisor [Governali]: ""I don't feel comfortable going on
the call and pounding the table when I just can't come up with a way to justify the fact that
3
[MFNX is] trading at 13 times 2001 revenue and I can't think of any catalysts except that it's
fundamentally one of the best positioned companies out there and it's reaffirmed [its
4
earnings] guidance."" Governali responded to the analyst: ""If you can't recommend it now,
when it is trading at nearly all time lows[, t]hen it should be pulled from the recommended
5
list."" The supervisor then listed multiple things the analyst could use to say good things
about the issuer, concluding ""while this stock may not soar in the next couple of months, it
will probably bounce back a little, and over the next 12 months, significantly outperform. l'll
6
call you in a bit."" In the end, MFNX remained on Goldman Sachs's Recommended List until
July - when the stock had dropped to $1.60 a share.
7
55.
On July 21, 2000, Goldman Sachs was preparing to begin research coverage on Storage
8
Networks. The analyst preparing the report said: ""The [Discounted Cash Flow] tab of [the
financial model] shows these revenues applied, and I cannot by any stretch of a variable
9
come up with a stock price much if at all above the current levels."" He asked his supervisor:
""What do we want to do? assign a share scarcity premium?
Or do we just pick it up
10
without a price target and an M[arket] O[utperformer]?"" Four days later, Goldman Sachs
initiated coverage with a Market Outperformer rating.
11
56.
In August 2000, James Golob, the co-head of global telecommunications services, wrote
12
Frank Governali, the other co-head, about the ""anomalous situation where our sector has
been tanking for 3-4 months and we globally still have a majority of stocks as
13
R[ecommened] L[ist]s as that is all the salesmen and clients care about"". Golob suggested
that Governali at least consider the approach he had taken: ""In Europe, we have found that
14
honour is preserved if we have a stock as an M[arket] O[utperformer] and the companies
can't complain because [it's] better than an M[arket] P[erformer]."" Governali agreed, saying
he planned ""to re-rate most of the CLECs, which is where the problem is most egregious.
15
The ratings were a residual from [a departed analyst], and I never changed them, not
wanting to disrupt things too much. But, its ridiculous. I've already met with the bankers,
16
and plan to move most of the companies down to M[arket] O[utperformer], from
R[ecommended] L[ist] before [another analyst] takes over completely in September.
I
17
don't think 1 would end up leaving only 7.5% as R[ecommended] L[ist], but the present 68%
is ridiculous.""
18
57.
An analyst asked Governali in April 2001 whether she should adjust the ""rating and price
19
target"" for 360 Networks since ""it is clear that TSIX is worth 0."" Governali suggested that
rather than change the rating, they might ""eliminate the price target."" He expressed concern
20
that: ""Changing the ratings now is probably not a good idea, because from an outsiders
perspective, who doesn't know anything, it may look like a belated ratings change
21
Governali was concerned that CNBC might ""[make] fun of [the analyst] on the air.'
58.
22
In August 2000, the issuer Mpower was included in Goldman Sachs's Recommended List.
At that time, Mpower's stock price was dropping rapidly. The analysts described the stock
drop as ""a death spiral."" One analyst questioned whether the drop was due to investor
23
concern over management at the company. The analyst covering Mpower, responded that
the price drop was ""just the stench of reality wafting through the air."" The other analyst felt
24
some vindication over the price drop, commenting that Goldman Sachs's investment
bankers had maligned him ""for lowering the [price] target from stupid heights to the merely
25
absurd.""
59.
In May 2001, WorldCom had Goldman Sachs's highest rating. Governali told his
1
counterpart in Europe that he ""would have loved to have cut ratings long ago.
Unfortunately, we can't cut [AT&T], because we're essentially restricted there. And without
2
cutting [AT&T], there is no consistency in cutting WCOM.""
3
60.
Also in May 2001, Governali told his counterpart in Europe: ""2001 estimates among sell side
analysts, and company guidance, are still to[o] high for most companies, and long term
4
growth rate assumptions are too high."" He said: ""As analyst and company expectations fall,
we can get more positive again.""
5
61.
In May 2001, Governali apprised an investment banker that an analyst at another firm had
just downgraded LVLT [Level 3 Communications]. Governali said he ""share many of the
6
same concerns that this analyst has."" At this time, and for another six weeks afterwards,
Goldman Sachs maintained LVLT at its highest rating - Recommended List.
7
62.
In a March 26, 2000 e-mail with the heading ""GBLX [Global Crossing] - I think they are
8
bullshitting us,"" an analyst stated that the company's revenue guidance ""does not make any
sense.
I think the answer is they wanted to obscure something sucking cash flow out of
9
the company.
They are hiding behind the complexity of their accounting."" The issuer
remained on Goldman Sachs's Recommended List.
10
63.
One analyst's self-evaluation in a the 360 degree review stated: ""Has subordinated personal
preferences on recommendations [citing two examples] for ""commercial' reasons.""
11
Research ratings
12
64.
The percentage of issuers being assigned one of the top two investment ratings
(Recommended List or Market Outperformer) ranged from 72% in the first quarter of 1999 to
13
50% in the last quarter of 2001. The percentage of companies assigned a Market
Underperformer rating never rose above 1.1% during this time.
14
In some instances Goldman Sachs terminated research coverage on issuers
15
without first having reduced its research ratings
16
65.
The number of companies for which Goldman Sachs ceased providing research coverage
increased from one in early 1999 to 280 at the end of 2001. Some of these companies may
17
have declared bankruptcy or ceased to exist during this period, while others were dropped
because the covering analyst left Goldman Sachs. In some cases, Goldman Sachs ceased
18
covering the company without first having downgraded its rating. A Goldman Sachs analyst
asked whether this was the ""proper protocol with respect to a bankrupt company.'
19
Comments to institutional investors, internal observations
20
66.
Between July 1999 and July 2001, WorldCom had Goldman Sachs's highest investment
21
rating - inclusion on the firm's ""Recommended List."" As noted above, the Recommended
List rating means ""expected to provide price gains of at least 10 percentage points greater
than the market over the next 6-18 months."" In April 2001 a hedge fund customer that had
a
22
short-term investment horizon asked Governali: ""wcom
buy sell or hold here at [$]20""?
Governali responded saying: ""sell."" Three months later, Goldman Sachs downgraded the
23
stock one-step to a Market Outperformer rating.
24
67.
In February 2002, a Goldman Sachs analyst rated Time Warner Telecom as a Market
Performer at a price of $11.75. Again, this rating relates to a time outlook of 6-18 months.
25
On February 21, 2002, the analyst was asked by another hedge fund that had a short-term
investment horizon at what price he would then buy Time Warner Telecom, the analyst
responded: ""$0.25,"" prompting a ""wow"" from the investor.
1
68.
On June 21, 2001, the covering analyst downgraded the stock Exodus from a
2
Recommended List rating to Market Outperformer. Both ratings have a time horizon of the
next 6-18 months. Shortly before the downgrade, the analyst met with at least two
3
institutional investors who e-mailed the analyst after their meetings:
a.
An institutional investor wrote the analyst on June 21, 2001: ""I wanted to write a
4
quick email to you to THANK you for your candor when you came into our offices
and gave me your teach-in on the company. You gave me the unbiased view, told
5
me the negatives I needed to know - - and basically gave me the ammo I needed to
prevent my PM from buying the stock [Exodus].'
6
b.
Another institutional investor wrote the analyst the same day: "" really appreciate
7
your straight forward comments on EXDS during dur conversation last week. Looks
like our worst concerns were realized yesterday. Fortunately, we were able to get
8
out of our last piece at around $5 and avoid the recent carnage in the shares. Still
painful, but it could have been a lot worse.
thanks""
9
69.
A comment about one analyst in a sales force survey said: ""His investment
10
recommendations have been abysmal and while I understand he communicates what he
really thinks to a sele[c]t few, his public ratings have been an embarrassment to the firm.""
11
70.
In the 2002 analyst review process, an investment banking vice president gave this
12
evaluation of an analyst: ""He also understands how to shade his comments to minimize the
impact of negative comments."" Another commenter said about this analyst: ""highly
commercial yet maintains research integrity.""
13
Draft research reports and expected research ratings were shared by analysts
14
with issuers and Goldman Sachs's investment bankers
15
71.
Goldman Sachs's policy permitted management of covered companies to review draft
research reports ""as long as any response is limited to correction of factual inaccuracies or
16
general indications as to the accuracy of projections."" Analysts were instructed that ""the
analyst's recommendation paragraph, investment summary, as well as any references to
17
other companies included in the report must be deleted prior to distribution to company
management.""
18
72.
Goldman Sachs's policy further permitted analysts to give investment bankers and covered
19
companies a ""heads up"" on the rating to be assigned to a company after the market closed
the day before a report was to issue. ""You may convey the conclusions of [pending
20
research] to IBD/Companies outside trading hours. For example, you can alert bankers and
companies just before the Morning Call that you are about to make a meaningful change.""
21
73.
In February 2000, an issuer whose securities were being underwritten by Goldman Sachs
[Net 2000] was engaged in roadshow presentations to potential investors. During the
22
roadshow period, an analyst sent Net2000 a draft financial model for the company. The
issuer then complained to Goldman Sachs's investment bankers that the analyst ""did not
23
build a separate model for GS in support of our roadshow
[and n]ow our concern is that
while GS's current estimates fit within our forecast, there is very little room for error.
24
Specifically, I am requesting that GS estimate a $60M negative EBITDA instead of the
current $57M. Our proposed estimate results in only a 10% cushion. I think this will ensure
25
that everyone's interest and credibility is protected."" The analyst changed the model to
increase the negative EBITDA, but not as much as requested by the issuer.
1
74.
In March 2001, one of Goldman Sachs's Hong Kong-based research analysts was preparing
to issue a sector report on the global underwater communications lines industry - predicting
2
price erosion for companies in that business. An investment banker suggested that the
Research Division get input from certain issuers ""BEFORE this piece is published.""
3
Governali responded: ""we wouldn't think of publishing this without direct input from the
company and their review of the report.""
4
75.
In September 2000, following news of a possible merger between two large
telecommunications providers, Governali wrote a research report on one of the companies.
5
Because that company was on a list of companies for which Goldman Sachs was then
providing advisory services (which could raise regulatory and other issues), he first ""had to
6
talk to our bankers and I[a]wyers before it went out.""
7
76.
Goldman Sachs initiated research coverage of Amazon.com on November 11, 1999. The
previous day, an analyst sent to Amazon a ""nearly final draft"" of the initial research report.
8
The draft did not include the rating to be assigned by Goldman Sachs, but did include the
analyst's evaluative comments and his financial models about the company. Amazon
9
responded with requests that the analyst change some phrases. Most of these comments
were incorporated by the analyst before submitting the research report to the firm's
10
compliance department.
11
77.
Goldman Sachs initiated research coverage of Internet equipment provider Equinix on
August 17, 2000. A draft of the research call note that omitted the price target and omitted
12
the Market Outperformer rating in all places except one was sent to the company by the
analyst on August 16 for comments before it was publicly released.
13
78.
In an August 22, 2000 e-mail, copied to an analyst, an investment banker writes: ""[analysts]
had a meeting with [WebEx] yesterday (which I attended part of). We discussed initiation
14
strategy and decided that likely to initiate (probably MO, no price target) shortly with a note
to be followed with a report by end of next week (given additional info from yesterday's
15
meeting and desire to iterate a bit with the company). [WebEx] was more than happy with
that approach as felt be beneficial to stock price to stagger good news.
16
79.
On January 19, 2001, WebEx management wrote to the analyst: ""As discussed, I want NO
17
mention of any funding issues in this written report. I told you if people called and asked
why your plan shows a need for modest funding, you can verbally tell them that
18
management believes they have adequate funding and it is probably because
manageme[nt] has a less conservative plan than you do."" The analyst responded, with an
19
attached revised report: ""The webx [sic] funding issues is a key area of investor concern, as
such will remove any mention from the top section of the note, but will address it in a
20
manner this [sic] is consistent with your recommendation for verbal responses to client
inquiries in a later section. To exclude it completely detracts from the intention of the note,
21
which is to address key investor concerns upfront and then give them a reason to buy the
stock."" WebEx management responded: ""Thank you. This is much better. The other note
22
said the company has a funding problem, but we think it isn't very big. This says that the
company believes it has enough funds, but there could be a problem; and if there is it will be
minor. Thanks again for the change."" The research report was issued on January 22, 2001.
23
80.
In April 2001, an analyst sent a draft research report to Global Crossing Ltd. in advance of
24
public release of the report. She received ""extensive comments"" from company officials.
The analyst wrote Governali that she had ""included [the issuer's) extensive comments.
I
25
also said we had slightly smoothed the negative edge (emphasis section up front and text)
from when they saw the report."" Moreover, the analyst said she ""promised them I'd re-email
the final report tonight so they could see our changes."" Despite all this, the issuer's officers
1
were still concerned and wanted to talk to Governali ""so that 'such an important industry
report which is going to have profound implications' will be to their liking.""
2
Goldman Sachs's investment banking division had input into the hiring of
3
Goldman Sachs's analysts
81.
Recruitment of analysts involved input from investment banking among others.
4
82.
In January 2000, an analyst and an investment banker stated that because Goldman
5
Sachs's research resources were inadequate in a particular sector, they needed to ""[h]elp
prevent Goldman, Sachs & Co. from turning away substantial revenue business.' They
6
proposed that a European analyst be reassigned temporarily to cover the U.S. sector until a
permanent analyst in the U.S. was hired.
7
83.
In March 2000, Goldman Sachs was considering hiring an analyst from a competing firm.
8
The day the candidate came to Goldman Sachs to interview, his first interview of the day
was with an investment banker.
9
84.
An undated Goldman Sachs chart listed analyst openings in each of the firm's research
10
sectors. For each vacancy, the chart lists a corresponding ""IBD Action Step."" For the PC
Hardware sector, research was ready to hire a candidate, but had to ""[c]heck with IBD team
11
comfort level with proposed analyst experience."" In the CommTech sector, there was
""[cjoncern whether IBD will be comfortable with ""development time period' (i.e., bringing up
12
to speed an internal hire and resulting suspension of coverage)."" In Wireless Services, one
offer had been extended but, because the offeree also wanted to bring with him to Goldman
Sachs two associates and one assistant, ""IBD approval [was] required for the junior team
13
hire. Equities is OK."" In the publishing sector, a targeted replacement had been identified,
but ""IBD approval required/confirm with [investment banker.]' For Taipei Head and
14
CommTech, a written offer required ""IBD approval.""
15
B.
GOLDMAN SACHS SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES.
16
Some supervisory procedures were in place, but contacts between investment
banking and research were not adequately monitored
17
85.
Goldman Sachs's policy permitted analysts to ""respond to generic requests for company or
18
industry information from members of the Investment Banking Division. For all other
requests, the analyst should ask the banker whether the request has been cleared by
19
Research Management. If the request has not been cleared by Research Management, the
analyst must wait until the banker has the appropriate clearance before responding to the
20
request.""
86.
21
In general, during the Relevant Period, Goldman Sachs failed to adopt sufficient procedures
and processes to ensure that the interaction between research analysts and investment
bankers or covered companies did not expose analysts to pressures or influences from
22
investment banking or covered companies.
23
87.
While one role of research analysts was to produce objective research, Goldman Sachs also
encouraged some analysts to participate in investment banking-related activities. As a
24
result of their participation in investment banking-related activities, those analysts were
subject to pressures or influences from investment banking and covered companies.
25
Goldman Sachs had knowledge of these pressures or influences yet failed adequately to
manage them to protect the objectivity of the firm's published research.
1
88.
Goldman Sachs's policies during the Relevant Period prohibited ""convey[ing] the conclusion
of pending research to anyone who does not need to know"" (including bankers and covered
2
companies), required that analysts only ""disseminate material research
via a written
product through the regular channels,"" and proscribed discussing ""material' pending
3
research"" which ""could include initiations of coverage and changes in ratings, estimates, or
price targets"" with anyone outside the firm or investment bankers. On certain occasions,
4
these policies were not consistently followed by analysts at the firm.
5
Some supervisory procedures were not adequate.
6
89.
The procedures or mechanisms in place to monitor or supervise communications (including
e-mails) between investment bankers and research analysts were not adequate. Similarly,
7
the procedures or mechanisms to monitor or supervise communications between analysts
and covered companies were not adequate. Additionally, there were inadequate
8
procedures or mechanisms to restrict, monitor, or supervise e-mail communications sent by
analysts from their home e-mail addresses.
9
10
11
C.
SUMMARY.
12
90.
Goldman Sachs portrayed its research as objective.
13
91.
At the same time, the reputation and involvement of its analysts in investment banking
activities was, at times, a factor used to solicit investment banking business. Analysts
14
assisted in evaluating and marketing certain investment banking business. Goldman Sachs
implemented a variety of programs that resulted in close cooperation between research
15
analysts and investment bankers in certain aspects of their work. These included the
research alignment initiative, consideration of investment banking comments in performance
16
evaluations of analysts, development of business plans, a firmwide award for cross-selling,
and analyst-created lists of investment banking transactions in their sectors. At times,
17
analysts assisted investment banking by identifying potential investment banking
opportunities, assisted in pitching investment banking business, and assisted in marketing
securities being underwritten by Goldman Sachs.
18
92.
Goldman Sachs research was subject to pressures or influences by investment bankers. At
19
times, bankers were allowed to review and comment on research reports and pressured
analysts about the timing to initiate coverage on specific issuers. At least one analyst felt it
20
was sometimes difficult to voice strong opinions. Some pitchbooks to issuers described how
analysts assisted investment banking efforts of the firm in preparing for an underwriting and
21
assisting in marketing IPO securities. Issuers sometimes were told which analysts would be
assigned to cover their companies and a list of that analyst's ratings for other companies.
22
93.
Investment bankers had input into decisions regarding the initiation and termination of
23
research coverage on particular issuers. At times, Research sought approval from
investment bankers before dropping coverage and investment bankers suggested certain
24
issuers that Research should be covering. In some instances, analysts dropped coverage
of issuers without first having downgraded the rating.
25
94.
Draft research reports and expected ratings sometimes were shared by analysts with
investment bankers and issuers. In some cases, analysts made changes to draft research
1
reports after getting feedback from issuers. Investment bankers also had input into the
hiring of Goldman Sachs analysts.
2
95.
Goldman Sachs did not adequately monitor contacts between research and investment
3
banking. In some cases, the supervisory procedures were not adequate. The procedures in
place to monitor communications between analysts and investment bankers or covered
4
companies were not adequate.

7
the benefit of investors. Goldman Sachs further agrees that it shall not claim, assert, or apply for a
tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any state, federal or local tax for any penalty amounts that

24
Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by the
division.
25
1
FINDINGS OF FACT
2
1. Morgan Stanley is, and was at all relevant times, a Delaware corporation and a registered
broker-dealer with its principal place of business located at 1585 Broadway, New York, New York
3
10036. Morgan Stanley is, and has been at all relevant times, an international financial services
firm that provides investment banking services to businesses, engages in retail and institutional
4
sales to its customers, and publishes research reports and ratings on stocks. In mid-2002, Morgan
Stanley had about 58,000 employees with 700 offices in twenty-eight countries. It had
5
approximately $450 billion in assets under management as of May 31, 2002.
2. The division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Act.
6
3. From at least July 1999 through 2001, Morgan Stanley engaged in acts and practices that
7
created conflicts of interest for its research analysts with respect to investment banking activities
and considerations. Morgan Stanley failed to manage those conflicts in an adequate or appropriate
8
manner. Some conflicts resulted from the fact that Morgan Stanley compensated its research
analysts, in part, based on the degree to which they helped generate investment banking business
9
for Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley also offered research coverage by its analysts as a marketing
tool to gain investment banking business. As a result, Morgan Stanley research analysts were
10
faced with a conflict of interest between helping generate investment banking business for Morgan
Stanley and their responsibilities to publish objective research reports that, if unfavorable to actual
11
or potential banking clients, could prevent Morgan Stanley from winning that banking business.
12
4. As lead underwriter in various stock offerings, Morgan Stanley also complied with the
issuers' directives to pay portions of the underwriting fees to other broker-dealers that served as
13
underwriters or syndicate members to publish research reports on the issuer. Morgan Stanley did
not take steps to ensure that these broker-dealers disclosed these payments in their research
reports. Further, Morgan Stanley did not cause the payments to be disclosed in the offering
14
documents or elsewhere as being for research.
15
5. Morgan Stanley also failed to reasonably supervise its analysts regarding the content of
their research reports.
16
I. 1. BACKGROUND
17
A.
The Investment Banking Function at Morgan Stanley
18
6. The investment banking division at Morgan Stanley advised corporate clients and helped
19
them execute various financial transactions, including the issuance of stock and other securities.
Morgan Stanley frequently served as the lead underwriter in initial public offerings (""IPOs"") -- the
20
first public issuance of stock of a company that has not previously been publicly traded -- and
follow-on offerings of securities.
21
7. During the relevant period, investment banking was an important source of revenues and
22
profits for Morgan Stanley. In 2000, investment banking generated more than $4.8 billion in
revenues, or approximately twenty-four percent of Morgan Stanley's total net revenues.
23
B.
The Role of Research Analysts at Morgan Stanley
24
8. Research analysts at Morgan Stanley covered a broad range of industry sectors and
published periodic reports on certain companies within those sectors. Analysts typically reviewed
25
the performance of their covered companies, evaluated their business prospects, and provided
analysis and projections concerning whether they presented good investment opportunities.
Through 2001, Morgan Stanley's equity research department had a system calling for rating
1
covered companies, from most to least positive, as ""Strong Buy,"" ""Outperform,"" ""Neutral,' or
""Underperform."" Analyst reports were disseminated to Morgan Stanley clients by mail and facsimile
2
and by financial advisors. Certain research reports were made available to retail clients who set up
accounts on Morgan Stanley's web site and, similarly, institutional clients were able to access
3
Morgan Stanley's research reports via accounts on Morgan Stanley's web site. In addition, certain
industry reports were available on Morgan Stanley's public web site. Certain institutional clients of
4
Morgan Stanley could also access research reports through the First Call subscription service. The
financial news media on occasion also reported Morgan Stanley analysts' ratings.
5
9. Morgan Stanley analysts also played an important role in assessing potential investment
6
banking transactions, in particular IPOs. Morgan Stanley's stated objective was to ""take public"" as
lead underwriter the leading companies in their respective industry sectors and to have its research
analysts serve as gatekeepers to the IPO process by investigating whether companies were
7
appropriate IPO candidates. Research analysts who endorsed an IPO candidate typically
participated in the competition to obtain the investment banking business and, if Morgan Stanley
8
was selected as lead underwriter, helped market the IPO to institutional investors, explained the
IPO to the firm's institutional and retail sales forces, and then issued research on the company.
9
10. Senior analysts at Morgan Stanley published individual research reports without pre-
10
publication review by research department supervisors. While reports were reviewed for
grammatical errors and for compliance with certain legal requirements, there was no system for
11
reviewing the recommendations or price targets included in the reports of senior analysts prior to
their publication.

I. 2.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVESTMENT BANKING AND RESEARCH
13
CREATED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH
ANALYSTS
14
11. Certain practices at Morgan Stanley created or maintained conflicts of interest for the firm's
research analysts with respect to investment banking considerations. These conflicts arose from
15
the inherent tension between the analysts' involvement in helping to win investment banking
business for Morgan Stanley and their responsibilities to publish objective research that, if negative
16
as to prospective banking clients, could prevent the firm from winning the banking business.
17
A.
Morgan Stanley Marketed Research Coverage, Including, at Times, Implicitly
Favorable Coverage, in Competing for Investment Banking Business
18
12. Morgan Stanley typically competed with other investment banks for selection as the lead
19
underwriter, or ""bookrunner,"" for securities offerings, including IPOs and follow-on offerings.
Significant financial rewards were at stake in these competitions. Sole or joint bookrunners
20
generally received the largest portion of underwriting fees, which were typically divided among the
participating investment banks. The bookrunner also established the allocation of shares in an
21
offering and typically retained the greatest number of shares for itself. The typical IPO generated
millions of dollars in investment banking fees for the bookrunner.
22
13. The process of selecting the lead underwriter typically culminated in a series of
23
presentations by competing investment banks called a ""bakeoff,' in which investment banks
competing for the business in a particular offering met with the issuer to present their qualifications
and offer investment banking and other services. As part of these presentations, investment banks
24
often provided issuers with a ""pitchbook,"" which typically described the investment bank's
credentials and services. In selecting the lead underwriters, issuers assessed a host of factors,
25
including the strength and quality of the bankers' research coverage. Issuers sought research
coverage of their stocks, believing such coverage would enhance the credibility of their businesses,
potentially lead to higher stock prices, and increase their exposure to the investing public.
1
14. Between 1999 and 2001, as part of the package of services it offered to issuers to win
investment banking business from certain issuers, Morgan Stanley typically committed that its
2
analysts would initiate (or continue) research coverage of the issuer if Morgan Stanley won the
banking competition. In so doing, Morgan Stanley used its analysts as a marketing tool to help
3
secure banking business. The promise of future research coverage was often a critical selling point
that enabled Morgan Stanley to obtain millions of dollars in investment banking fees. Research
coverage was part of a package of services for which Morgan Stanley was compensated in those
4
investment banking deals.
5
15. Analysts played an important role in Morgan Stanley's pitches for banking business. Along
with investment bankers and others, analysts were typically presented as part of the Morgan
6
Stanley ""team"" that would consummate the transaction. The pitchbooks typically identified the
analysts on the téam and dedicated several pages to the analysts' experience, credentials, and
7
specific role in the contemplated transaction. Analysts drafted portions of the pitchbook and almost
always attended the presentations for IPO business. The pitchbooks typically compared Morgan
8
Stanley analysts favorably to their counterparts at competing firms, citing their rankings in analyst
polls and other measures
9
16. Morgan Stanley typically identified its analysts as a favorable factor that issuers should
10
consider in selecting Morgan Stanley for investment banking business. For example, in describing
one reason Loudcloud, Inc., should name Morgan Stanley as bookrunner for its 1999 IPO, the
11
pitchbook referred to two senior analysts as a ""dream team"" who would ""articulate Loudcloud's story
to investors in a way that no other investment bank can match."" Another pitchbook described two
senior analysts as ""the most powerful combination in the extended enterprise space
ever.""
12
17. In its pitches to obtain investment banking business, Morgan Stanley typically promised
13
future research coverage as among the package of services it would provide. For example, in a
pitchbook provided to iBeam Broadcasting Corp. to obtain its IPO business, Morgan Stanley said it
14
would ""provide ongoing research coverage and aftermarket trading"" and, in another instance, said
""coverage would be initiated immediately after the quiet period. Additional research reports will
15
follow on a regular basis thereafter."" Morgan Stanley won the iBeam IPO business and received
investment banking fees of approximately $3.8 million. Another pitchbook, in a chronology of how
16
the IPO would unfold, stated: ""Research coverage initiated on day 26,"" which was the day research
coverage could be initiated by an underwriter following an IPO. Morgan Stanley made comparable
17
commitments to other prospective banking clients. Another Morgan Stanley pitchbook, provided to
Transmeta Corp. in July 2000 in connection with its IPO, said ""we view research as an ongoing
18
commitment,"" and offered to ""continue regular publication of research reports."" Morgan Stanley
won the Transmeta IPO business and received investment banking fees of approximately $9.5
19
million. In other pitchbooks, Morgan Stanley emphasized its ""aftermarket support"" services, which il
expressly described as including future research coverage. For example, a pitchbook presented to
AT&T Latin America said Morgan Stanley ""is committed to bolstering an IPO's performance in the
20
aftermarket through extensive equity research and active market-making."" (Emphasis added.)
Morgan Stanley pitchbooks often identified the specific number of reports its analysts published on
21
other companies, giving implicit guidance on how many reports issuers could expect to receive if
they selected Morgan Stanley as lead banker.
22
18. Further, Morgan Stanley at times implicitly suggested that analysts would provide favorable
23
research coverage, pending completion of due diligence, by noting analysts' past favorable
coverage and/or emphasizing its enthusiastic support for the issuer. For example, when Morgan
24
Stanley sought investment banking business from Convergys Corp., the company already had beer
covered for two years by a senior Morgan Stanley analyst who, as the pitchbook mentioned four
25
times, considered Convergys to have been the analyst's ""#1 stock pick"" over those years. (During
that time period, the stock price had appreciated 98%.) The May 2001 pitchbook then described
the analyst as the ""voice of the issuing company,"" who would work ""in tandem"" with Convergys
1
management to position its story to investors. In the following month, June 2001, the senior analyst
downgraded Convergys from Strong Buy to Outperform, still a favorable rating, then later upgraded
2
Convergys back to Strong Buy in December 2001.
19. In other instances, Morgan Stanley pitchbooks identified a particular analyst's history of
3
issuing Strong Buy or Outperform ratings on other companies. Some pitchbooks also identified
instances in which other stocks covered by Morgan Stanley analysts increased in price following
4
their IPOs. For example, the Morgan Stanley pitchbook provided to Transmeta Corp. in July 2000
emphasized how one analyst's ""support"" of eight semiconductor IPOs since 1997 had ""resulted in
5
unparalleled performance in the public market,"" and included a line graph showing a dramatic
increase in the stocks' price from 1998 through March 2000.
6
20. In another instance, after Loudcloud management informed Morgan Stanley in 1999 that
7
research coverage was a key factor in its selection of the bookrunner for its IPO, Morgan Stanley's
head of worldwide investment banking informed the issuer in an e-mail that the firm had ""developed
8
a successful model which combines the best of technology and telecom research at Morgan
Stanley to properly position Loudcloud in the capital markets; specifically, enthusiastic sponsorship""
9
by two research analysts who covered Loudcloud's sector. He added: ""I commit to putting the
entire franchise behind Loudcloud to achieve the best valuation and after market performance, as
10
well as unmatched strategic advice post-IPO."" Morgan Stanley won the Loudcloud IPO business
and received investment banking fees of approximately $4.7 million.
11
21. In addition to pitchbooks, Morgan Stanley occasionally provided draft or ""mock"" research
12
reports to issuers to provide an example of how analysts might describe the issuer to investors.
The draft or mock reports described the issuers in favorable terms without including ratings or price
13
targets.
22. Morgan Stanley's commitments to provide research coverage were not limited to pitches for
14
IPO business. Morgan Stanley obtained investment banking business for follow-on offerings of
companies that its analysts did not cover in part by promising to initiate future coverage.
15
23. Morgan Stanley consistently honored its commitments to provide research coverage,
16
initiating or maintaining coverage when it won the investment banking business.
17
24. In Morgan Stanley's annual performance evaluation process, some analysts and bankers
noted their success in obtaining banking fees by promising future research coverage. For example,
18
in a November 3, 1999 e-mail, an investment banker listed several banking transactions that he
said Morgan Stanley had won because it committed that a particular highly-rated analyst would
19
initiate research coverage. Specifically, the banker wrote that Morgan Stanley had won two
transactions totaling $13.4 million in fees from Veritas Software Corp. ""just for promising that [the
20
senior analyst] would pick up coverage after the deals."" The banker observed that this had
""enraged"" competing firms, which said it was ""unprecedented"" to give an underwriter with no
21
previous research coverage such a high share of the fees. The banker added: ""The response from
the CEO to those firms -- 'you don't have [the senior analyst].' Other analyst evaluations as well as
other internal Morgan Stanley documents identified additional instances in which it was stated that
22
Morgan Stanley won investment banking business in large part because its analysts committed to
initiate coverage.
23
B.
Investment Banking Concerns Influenced Morgan Stanley's Decisions
24
Whether to Initiate or Continue Research Coverage
25
25. The decision to initiate or continue research coverage of certain companies was influenced,
at least in part, by whether those companies were actual or prospective investment banking clients
of Morgan Stanley.
1
26. In one instance, in May 2001, the liaison between the research and investment banking
divisions was advised that a poultry company, Pilgrim's Pride, was seeking equity research
2
coverage in connection with a prospective high-yield offering. The liaison made clear that Morgan
Stanley should not commit to providing coverage until it received a certain amount of investment
3
banking fees from the company:
Be careful with this one. Under no circumstances should we commit
4
unless we get the books and at least $3-5mm in fees, with the money
in the bank before we pick up coverage. We can tell them it will go in
the queue and we cannot promise them a rating. It costs about
5
$1 mm to pick up coverage of a stock and there are also meaningful
ongoing expenses to maintain.
6
27. Morgan Stanley analysts on occasion also declined to cover some companies that refused
7
to award investment banking business to Morgan Stanley. One senior analyst wrote in a 2000 self-
evaluation that the analyst had declined Sabre Group's requests for research coverage for four
8
years and that the analyst had ""insisted that we first be mandated on a large investment banking
transaction."" Generally, analysts select which of the many companies in a sector they will cover.
9
This senior analyst did not consider Sabre to be one the analyst needed to cover, unless Morgan
Stanley were to be mandated on an investment banking transaction. When Sabre provided Morgan
10
Stanley with banking business in connection with its spin-off from AMR Corp., the analyst initiated
coverage of Sabre with an Outperform rating in March 2000.
11
28. Morgan Stanley also declined to initiate coverage of Concord/EFS, Inc. Concord initially
12
retained Morgan Stanley as bookrunner for a 1999 secondary offering, but then hired a different
bank as bookrunner after Morgan Stanley declined Concord's request that it commit to initiating
13
coverage with a ""Strong Buy"" rating. Though Concord continued to offer part of that investment
banking business to Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley withdrew, and it did not initiate research
coverage of Concord at that time. In the fall of 2000, Morgan Stanley sought investment banking
14
business from Concord in connection with another secondary offering. Concord's management told
Morgan Stanley's senior analyst that it wanted an advance view of the analyst's initial rating. After
15
completing two to three months of preliminary due diligence, the analyst told Concord that, if
coverage were to be initiated at that time, the analyst tentatively would issue a ""Strong Buy"" up to a
16
certain valuation level. Morgan Stanley also provided Concord with a draft research report, which,
according to an e-mail written by an investment banker, was part of Morgan Stanley's ""marketing
17
efforts."" When Morgan Stanley was not awarded the 2000 investment banking business, its analyst
did not initiate coverage at that time, despite the analyst's initial view that Concord had emerged as
18
a leader in its industry that preliminarily merited a ""Strong Buy.'
19
29. Morgan Stanley also initiated coverage of eBay, Inc., in part with the hope of obtaining
investment banking business. After Morgan Stanley initially lost the IPO business for eBay in 1998,
20
a senior Morgan Stanley analyst met with eBay's chief executive officer and provided a draft
research report on the company. After Morgan Stanley nevertheless lost the IPO business, the
21
analyst initiated coverage on eBay on its first day of trading with an Outperform rating. The analyst
was the only one covering eBay, since firms in the underwriting syndicate were prohibited from
22
initiating coverage until after the 25-day ""quiet period"" had expired. It is the only time that the senior
analyst initiated coverage of a company on its first day of trading. Later, in 1999 and again in 2001,
eBay awarded two banking transactions to Morgan Stanley, with total fees of approximately $1.2
23
million. In the senior analyst's self-evaluation for 2000, the analyst stated, as part of the analyst's
""philosophy"" for Morgan Stanley's ""Internet banking efforts,' that ""when we miss a winning IPO, we
24
should work like crazy (with tons of ideas) to secure a spot as M&A advisor (USWeb/CKS) or book
running manager on follow-on offerings (eBay).'
25

C.
Morgan Stanley Research Analysts Performed Investment Banking
Functions
2
30. Morgan Stanley research analysts performed a number of investment banking-related
3
functions. They identified potential IPO and merger and acquisition transaction candidates for the
investment banking department, participated in soliciting investment banking business for the firm,
4
and participated in road shows and other efforts to sell Morgan Stanley-underwritten IPOs and
secondary offerings to institutional investors. At times, analysts also had discussions about
5
business strategy with investment banking clients directly, and one senior analyst was described a
a relationship manager with certain investment banking clients.
6
31. Morgan Stanley kept a record of each analyst's contribution to investment banking
revenues. Each year, a ""Revenue Share Analysis"" was prepared that listed every investment
7
banking transaction in which each analyst had participated, the revenues from each transaction, a
rating on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being ""critical"" to the deal) of the analyst's contribution to the
8
transaction, and a calculation of the analyst's ""share"" of the credit for the revenues secured from th
transaction. The Revenue Share Analysis also recorded investment gains on Morgan Stanley
9
investments in companies covered by the analyst.
10
32. One senior analyst's involvement in investment banking activities was such that several
investment bankers at the firm regarded the analyst as tantamount to an investment banker. One
11
banker wrote that the analyst was the most committed and focused banker with whom he had ever
worked. Another wrote that the analyst was a ""commercial animal"" who would do anything
12
appropriate to win underwriting mandates. The analyst's supervisor wrote in 1999 that the analyst'
focus was primarily on banking and that, notwithstanding the growing demand for the analyst's time
13
on investment banking matters, the anälyst needed to devote more attention to institutional
investors and the firm's institutional sales force.
14
33. The analyst's own self-evaluation prominently mentioned the analyst's assistance to
investment banking in selecting and generating investment banking business and large fees,
15
stating: ""Bottom line, my highest and best use is to help MSDW win the best Internet IPO
mandates (and to ensure that we have the appropriate analysts and bankers to serve the
16
companies well) (emphasis in original). It also prominently listed the deals and revenues from
the analyst's nvestment-banking connected efforts:
17
Internet Investment Banking, a Record Year with $205MM+ YTD
18
Revenue, [20+] Pending Financings, Co-Coverage (Leverage) in
85% of Cases, 6 of 6 Tech IBD Revenue Generating Clients,
19
Internet Category was #1 Revenue Generator in Tech IBD
($505MM YTD Tech Revenue) (Emphasis in original.)
20
OK, the numbers (see Attachment A): Forty investment banking
21
transactions ($143MM in fees)
22
It's notable that 96% of the $205MM in revenue was derived from
clients new to the firm since 1995! Exceptions were America Online,
Compaq, Hearst and Sotheby's. And 1 have been very involved in this
23
business. (Emphasis added.)
24
D.
Investment Banking Was an Important Factor in Determining Research
Analysts' Compensation
25
34. From 1999 through 2001, participation in investment banking activities was a factor in
determining the total compensation awarded to some Morgan Stanley research analysts. These
1
analysts thus faced a conflict of interest between helping win investment banking business for
Morgan Stanley and publishing negative research that could prevent Morgan Stanley from winning
2
that banking business.
3
35. The annual salaries paid to senior Morgan Stanley analysts and other senior Morgan
Stanley personnel typically were comparatively small components of their total annual
4
compensation. The majority of their total annual compensation was paid in the form of a bonus. In
2000, one senior analyst received a year-end bonus that was 90 times greater than the analyst's
base salary.
5
36. The total compensation paid to analysts was based in part on Morgan Stanley's total
6
revenues for a particular year, including the investment banking fees that Morgan Stanley received.
Thus, the success or failure of the investment banking division determined, in part, the total amount
7
of funds available to pay employee compensation in any given year, including analyst
compensation.
8
1.
Analysts Rated Their Contributions to Investment Banking
9
37. The level of contribution to investment banking transactions was an important factor in the
10
annual evaluations of Morgan Stanley's analysts and compensation decisions.
11
38. As part of the annual performance evaluation process, analysts were asked to submit self-
evaluations that, among other things, discussed their contributions to Morgan Stanley. Analysts
often included in their self-evaluations a discussion of their involvement in investment banking,
12
including a description of specific transactions, the fees generated, and the role the analyst played
in each deal. For example, one-quarter of the 1999 self-evaluation of one analyst was dedicated to
13
the analyst's role in investment banking activities, and identified forty transactions that year that had
generated a total of $143 million in fees.
14
39. As part of the evaluation process, the analysts also provided a rating of their contributions to
15
specific banking transactions. Analysts were instructed to complete a Transaction Summary
Worksheet (""TSW"") in which they graded their roles in specific deals on a scale of 1-5. Instructions
16
provided to each analyst described the rating system as follows:
5 = critical to deal
17
4 = important to development and execution
3 = solid contribution
18
2 = limited contribution
1
= contribution limited to providing research coverage
19
40. Analysts were also instructed to comment on important aspects of any transaction,
20
including, for example, whether the ""promise of coverage was critical to winning"" the mandate. The
instructions informed analysts that supplying the information called for in the TSWs was an
21
""important part"" of their annual evaluation process.
2.
Investment Bankers Evaluated Analysts' Performance
22
41. Morgan Stanley also solicited and received the investment bankers' assessment of the
23
analysts' performance on the same transactions. Morgan Stanley's liaison between the research
and investment banking divisions compiled and summarized the bankers' evaluations of the
24
analysts' role in each deal and then prepared a final TSW listing for each transaction that provided
a joint evaluation of the analysts' contributions to each deal.
25
1
42. Finally, as part of Morgan Stanley's ""360 degree"" review process, in which employees
confidentially reviewed one another, investment bankers submitted written opinions of analysts with
2
whom they worked.
3
43. Investment bankers thus played a role in the annual evaluation of research analysts by
providing substantive information that was considered in the year-end evaluation process and input
4
into the determination of the analysts' compensation for that year. The investment bankers' role in
the evaluation process created a conflict of interest for analysts, who hoped for positive evaluations
from investment bankers at the same time that they were charged with issuing objective research
5
reports that, if negative, could have impeded Morgan Stanley's ability to win future investment
banking business from the covered companies.
6
3.
Investment Banking Was the Factor Accorded the Greatest
7
Weight by Management in Reviewing Management's Initial
Determination of Proposed Analysts' Compensation
8
44. In 1999 and 2000, analyst compensation was set primarily by a managing director in the
9
equity research division. The managing director made an initial determination of proposed
compensation for all analysts and ranked the analysts based on that determination. The managing
10
director then ranked the analysts based on their composite scores in nine categories. The
managing director then compared the two rankings before forwarding the compensation
11
recommendations to superiors.
12
45. The nine categories used to rank the analysts included the amount of investment banking
revenues attributed to analysts based on their involvement in transactions (relative weight of 33%)
13
and eight other categories related to core research activities, including: (1) poll rankings from the
Institutional Investor and other sources (19%); (2) poll ranking from institutional equity division sales
(12%); (3) firm activities and ability to be a team player (11%); (4) the ""hit ratio"" in vote gathering
14
from institutional clients (7%); (5) rank in vote gathering from institutional clients (7%); (6) stock
picking (active portfolio vs. passive portfolio) (6%); (7) stock picking (active portfolio vs. index
15
portfolio) (3%); and (8) poll ranking from retail sales (2%). Thus, the managing director assigned a
one-third weight to investment banking revenues -- the highest weight given to any single category.
16
46. The impact that an analyst's contribution to investment banking revenues could have on the
17
determination of the analyst's compensation is shown by the compensation of one Morgan Stanley
senior analyst in 1999 and 2000. In 1999, the analyst who received the highest compensation
18
among Morgan Stanley research analysts had a composite score that ranked only 11th overall, but
ranked first in investment banking revenues.
19
47. In 2000, the same analyst continued to rank first in investment banking revenues: the total
20
investment banking revenues that the analyst helped Morgan Stanley obtain more than doubled. In
most other categories, however, the analyst's performance declined from 1999, and the analyst's
21
composite score dropped to 19th overall. In 2000, the analyst ranked only 70th out of 111 analysts
in stock picking, and the analyst's self-evaluation conceded that 2000 had been the analyst's worst
22
stock-picking year in fifteen years. Nevertheless, this analyst's total salary and bonus for 2000
increased by approximately $8.7 million as compared to 1999, again ranking first among all Morgan
Stanley analysts.
23
1.3.
MORGAN STANLEY DID NOT DISCLOSE THAT IT PAID
24
$2.7 MILLION OF UNDERWRITING FEES AT ISSUERS' DIRECTION TO
OTHER INVESTMENT BANKS TO PROVIDE RESEARCH COVERAGE
25
48. In at least twelve stock offerings in which it was selected as lead underwriter from 1999
through 2001, Morgan Stanley paid $2.7 million of the underwriting fees to approximately twenty-
1
five investment banks. Internal Morgan Stanley documents described these payments as ""research
guarantees"" or ""guaranteed economics for research."" Other internal Morgan Stanley documents
2
noted instances in which the bank receiving the payment ""will write."" Morgan Stanley made these
payments from the offering proceeds at the direction of the issuers.
3
49. These ""research guarantee"" payments included more than $670,000 paid to three
investment banks in connection with an offering by Veritas Software Corp. in December 1999; more
4
than $816,000 paid to seven banks in connection with an Agile Software Corp. offering in
December 1999; and more than $440,000 paid to five banks in connection with an offering by Atmel
5
Corp. in February 2000. The individual disbursements ranged from two payments of just over
$6,000 each to three payments of more than $225,000 each.
6
50. The issuers' registration statements and other offering documents identified the other banks
7
as part of the underwriting syndicates and as receiving payments, but did not specifically disclose
the payments as being for research. Morgan Stanley did not take steps to ensure that these banks
8
disclosed these payments in their research reports. Morgan Stanley also did not cause the
payments to be disclosed in offering documents or elsewhere as having been for research.
9
I. 4.
MORGAN STANLEY FAILED REASONABLY TO
10
SUPERVISE ITS SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYSTS
A.
Morgan Stanley Had No System for Reviewing
11
the Ratings Issued by Its Senior Analysts
12
51. Morgan Stanley failed reasonably to supervise its senior research analysts. The firm
required only non-officer-level analysts to submit their initial ratings and proposed changes in
13
ratings for review by the Stock Selection Committee. Senior analysts -- principals and managing
directors -- were not subject to this requirement. in addition, Morgan Stanley had no effective
14
system in place for reviewing the ratings of its senior analysts against changed conditions.
15
52. Morgan Stanley's lack of an effective review system allowed some principal and managing
director analysts to maintain Outperform ratings unchanged on declining stocks without any review
16
by management. For example, in 2000 and 2001, four senior analysts maintained Outperform
ratings unchanged on 13 stocks as the prices of the stocks declined by over 74 percent. The
17
names of the stocks, their percentage declines, and the number of months without a change in the
Outperform rating are shown on the following chart:

53. Not until late 2001, after complaints from Institutional Sales persons made as part of the
year-end evaluation process, did management state to one of the analysts: ""Don't let your ratings
2
get stale; change them ahead of expected price action.""
3
B.
Morgan Stanley's Analysts Virtually Never Used the Lowest Rating in the
Firm's Stock Rating System
4
54. From 1995 to March 2002, Morgan Stanley publicly stated that it had a four-category rating
5
system: Strong Buy; Outperform; Neutral; and Underperform, ""Underperform"" was defined as
follows: ""Given the current price, these securities are not expected to perform as well as other
6
stocks in the universe covered by the analyst.' ""Although Morgan Stanley stated that it had a four-
category system, its analysts virtually never used the ""Underperform"" rating and, in effect, used a
7
three-category system. From 1999 through 2001, the firm published research on approximately
1,000 North American company stocks. No more than three of the 1033 stocks covered over the
course of 1999 were given an Underperform rating; no more than five of the 1058 stocks covered
8
over the course of 2000 received that rating; and no more than six of the 1030 stocks covered over
the course of 2001 were rated Underperform.
9
55. Morgan Stanley management was aware that analysts were not using the ""Underperform""
10
rating, but did not correct the problem until March 2002, when a new rating system was instituted.
II.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
12
1. The Alaska division of banking, securities, and corporations has jurisdiction over this matter
pursuant to Alaska Securities Act.
13
2. The division finds that Morgan Stanley violated AS 45.55.060(a)(7) and AS 45.55.060(b)(1)
in that:
14
a)
The relationship between investment banking and research created conflicts of
interest for Morgan Stanley research analysts;
15
b)
Morgan Stanley did not disclose that it paid $2.7 million of underwriting fees at
issuers' direction to other investment banks to provide research coverage; and
16
c)
Morgan Stanley failed reasonably to supervise its senior research analysts.]
17
3. The division finds the following relief appropriate and in the public interest.
18
III.
ORDER
19
On the basis of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Morgan Stanley's consent to the
20
entry of this Order, for the sole purpose of settling this matter, prior to a hearing and without admitting
or denying any of the Findings of Fact or Conclusions of Law,
21
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
22
1. This Order concludes the investigation by the division and any other action that the division
23
could commence under applicable Alaska law on behalf of the State of Alaska as it relates to Morgan
Stanley on the subject of the investigations, provided however, that excluded from and not covered by

FACTUAL SUMMARY
10
11
12
1. The Division of Banking and Securities (the Division) administers and enforces the
13
Alaska Securities Act (the Act) at AS 45.55 and regulations adopted under the Act at
3 AAC 08.
14
15
2. In September 2004, the Division received information that Sheila Miller and Outlook
16
Inc., dba Outlook Financial Services (OPS) might be conducting investment advisory
17
business at 2525 Blueberry Road, Suite 103, Anchorage, AK, 99503.
18
3. The Division reviewed the records of the NASD Central Registration Depository
19
(CRD) database and determined that Ms. Miller was not registered with the Division
20
as an investment advisor representative (IAR) and that OFS was not registered as an
21
investment advisor.
22
4. CRD records show that Ms. Miller voluntarily terminated employment as an agent for
23
broker-dealer First Securities USA, Inc. (First Securities) on May 31, 2002. Ms.
24
Miller was registered with the Division as an agent of First Securities from November
25
5, 1999 to June 7) 2002 (and with two other broker-dealers from June 1985 to
Outlook Financial Services and Sheila Miller-Consent Order AK # 06-06 S
Page I of7
1
November 1999). OFS and Ms. Miller were not registered to conduct investment
2
advisory business in Alaska during these time periods.
3
5. The Division interviewed Ms. Miller at the OFS office and determined that investment
4
advisoly business was being conducted. Further investigation of OFS and Ms. Miller
5
found that the unregistered investment advisory activity began after her termination
6
with First Securities USA, Inc. on May 31, 2002. Based upon our preliminary
7
examination, the Division determined that it was in the public interest to limit OFS
8
and Ms. Miller from obtaining new investment advisoly clients and allow OFS and
9
Ms. Miller to submit applications for registration under the Act.
10
6. On December 16, 2004, the Division received an initial application from OPS to
11
become registered as an investment advisor.
12
7. On January 26, 2005, Ms. Miller passed the NASD Series 65 examination, thus
13
completing the initial application requirements necessary to become registered as an
14
investment advisor representative.
15
8. On April 12,2005, OFS completed the initial application requirements of 3 AAC
16
08.011(j) sufficient to allow a pre-registration examination of its investment advisory
17
business.
18
9. The pre-registration examination began on May 9, 2005 and concluded on June 30,
19
2005 with an exit conference where the exam findings were presented to Ms. Miller.
20
Such findings were included in a Division letter of August 1, responded to by OFS on
21
August 31 and are provided below.

2
from June 2002 to present without proper registration as an investment adviser
3
representative (IAR).

12.
OFS and Ms. Miller violated AS 45.55.020(e) and 3 AAC 08.029(a) by having
5
constructive custody of three client securities accounts by virtue of obtaining and using
6
the clients' passwords to access their accounts. OFS and Ms. Miller have destroyed the
7
passwords they had for the three accounts and instructed the clients to change their
8
password and not provide anyone at OFS their account passwords in the future.
9
13.
OFS and Ms. Miller violated AS 45.55.023(8) by not disclosing to its clients that OFS
10
and Ms. Miller had custody of client funds. OFS and Ms. Miller by rectifying number
11
12 above, affirm they do not currently have custody (or constructive custody) of any
12
clientfunds and therefore the requirement to disclose custody has been eliminated.
13
14.
OFS and Ms. Miller violated 3 AAC 08.040(i) by not having, at the time of the exam, a
14
separate financial statement for the investment advisory business (excluding the other
15
businesses Outlook Inc. conducts.) Subsequent to the examination, OFS presented a
16
separate financial statement for just its advisory business.

18
in all files.
19
16.
OFS and Ms. Miller violated 3 AAC 08.040(a)(9) by not maintaining evidence of
20

21
and Ms. Miller affirm that no discretion will be exercised over any client 'saccounts
22
unless and until the proper written authority has been obtained and properly
23
documented in the clientfiles.
24
17.

14
obtained copies of these written agreements for its files.

18
document allfuture performance figures and rates of return presented to clients and

maintain worksheets' demonstrating how each calculation was completed.
20

strict confidentiality of client records. OFS staff members share office space with a
22
third party tenant. This office has OFS file cabinets, an OFS computer station, and an
23
OFS telephone and has no room divider to separate the space. Ms. Miller has revised
24
the OFS policy manual to address the shared facility. In addition, the rental agreement
25
with the third party tenant has been revised to include the long standing verbal
agreement that neither party will access information belonging to the other and that

CONSENT AGREEMENT WITH THE 13TH REGIONAL CORPORATION
8
I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
9
1. The Division of Banking and Securities (the division), is responsible for
10
administering the Alaska Securities Act (the Act) at AS 45.55 and regulations adopted
11
under the Act at 3 AAC 08.
12
2. The 13th Regional Corporation (13th Region), of 1156 Industry Drive, Seattle, WA
13
98188, is an Alaska Native corporation organized under the Alaska Native Claims
14
Settlement Act (ANCSA). It is subject to the requirements of AS 45.55.139 and pertinent
15
regulations due to its having more than 500 shareholders and assets exceeding
16
$1,000,000.
17
3. The 13th Region scheduled its 2005 annual meeting for August 27, 2005 and
18
solicited proxies in connection with it. The proxy solicitation materials distributed to
19
shareholders and the division included a Notice of Annual Meeting & Proxy Statement
20
booklet as well as Audited Financial Statements for the year ending December 31, 2004.
21
4. The division initially received a complaint dated August 10, 2005 from a
22
shareholder alleging the 13th Region violated the Alaska Securities Act and regulations by
23 making materially false or misleading statements in its proxy solicitation materials.
24
Additional complaints and correspondence from that same shareholder were dated August
25
16, 2005, August 30, 2005, October 20, 2005, October 23, 2005 and October 25, 2005.
ALASKA ORDER #06-09 S
Page 1
1
The division asked for responses and clarification from the 13th Region and received letters
2
dated September 19, 2005, October 10, 2005 and December 3, 2005.
3
5. The division considered 17 complaints. Two of them, as described in the following
4
two paragraphs, are the subject of this settlement agreement.
5
6. The shareholder complaint stated that Liz Ross' compensation as the acting CEO
6
was not disclosed and was not included in a total of compensation paid to ""all officers and
7
directors as a group"". The 13th Region responded that her compensation was included in
8
the financial statements but it had inadvertently omitted to disclose her compensation in
9
their 2005 proxy statement.
10
7. The shareholder complaint also stated that the 13th Region failed to make
11
Sufficient disclosure about a settlement made to a former CEO. The 13th Region stated
O's
that it did not include the settlement amount in the Director Compensation portion of the
12
13
2005 proxy statementas neither the payment nor the settlement agreement was made in
2004
14
15
II. FINDINGS
16
8. A solicitation of proxies for an annual meeting must be free of materially false and
17
misleading statements (AS 45.55.160.) 3 AAC 08.315 provides that a misrepresentation
18
includes a statement that, at the time and under the circumstances inwhich it is made
19
(1) is false or misleading with respect to a material fact; (2) omits a material fact necessary
20
21
inorder to make a statement made in the solicitation not false or misleading ""and that ""A
22
misrepresentation is material if there is substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder
23
would consider it important in deciding how to vote.""
24
9. 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2)(B) states that the corporation provides a written proxy
25
statement which includes ""all current remuneration distributed or accrued and (a statement)
ALASKA ORDER #06-09 S
Page 2
1
of all future remuneration contributed during the corporation's last fiscal year on behalf
2
of "" all officers and directors as a group; stating the number of persons in the group
3
without naming them; ""
4
10. The 13th Region's 2005 proxy statement section labeled ""Director Compensation""
5
provides information on board member compensation, sale of the UPS store, and the five
6
most highly compensated officers and directors. However, it omitted to state the total
7
remuneration to all officers and directors and omitted to state the total number in that
8
group. The division finds the 13th Regionviolated 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2)(8) by failing to
9
provide this information.
10
11. 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2)(A), requires the 13th Region to disclose in its annual proxy
11
statement all current remuneration distributed or accrued and (a statement) of all future
12
remuneration contributed during the corporation's last fiscal year on behalf of each of the
13
five most highly compensated directors or officers for his services in all capacities to the
14
corporation and its subsidiaries, naming each such person;. Former CEO Krajewski was
15
included in the corporation's proxy statement as one of its five most highly compensated
16
personnel. A financial settlement to Mr. Krajewski was accrued in the 2004 financial
17
statements and reported to shareholders. The above regulation would also require that this
18
compensation be disclosed in the 2005 proxy statement along with the rest of Mr.
19
Krajewski's compensation. This settlement amount was not included in the 2005 proxy
20
statement as part of his distributedor accrued compensation. Therefore, the division finds
21
the 13th Region violated 3AAC.08.345(b)(2)(A)by failing to disclose this information.

FINAL ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST
7
AND IMPOSING A PREFILING REQUIREMENT
8
I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
9
1. The Division of Banking and Securities (the division), is responsible for
10
administering the Alaska Securities Act (the Act) at AS 45.55 and regulations adopted
11
under the Act at 3 AAC 08.
12
2. Chugach Alaska Corporation (CAC), of 560 East 34 TH Avenue, Anchorage, AK
13
99503, is an Alaska Native corporation organized under the Alaska Native Claims
14
Settlement Act (ANCSA). It is subject to the requirements of AS 45.55.139 and pertinent
15
regulations due to its having more than 500 shareholders and assets exceeding
16
$1,000,000.
17
3. Robert Burk (Respondent) is a shareholder of CAC and was an independent
18
candidate for the board of directors that was elected at the October 14, 2006 annual
19
meeting. As required by 3 AAC 08.355, the Respondent submitted proxy solicitation
20
materials to the division on September 25, 2006 and distributed them to shareholders.
21
4. The division received a complaint dated October 5, 2006 from CAC alleging that
22
the Respondent violated the Alaska Securities Act and regulations by making materially
23
false or misleading statements in his proxy solicitation materials and failed to make certain
24
disclosures mandated by 3 AAC 08.355 in his proxy statement. The division asked for
25

5. A Temporary Order to Cease and Desist; And Notice of a Right to a Hearing
4
Regarding Prefiling (AK order #07-01S) dated January 10, 2007 was sent to the

Respondent by certified mail and the delivery receipt was signed on January 19, 2007.

II.
FINDINGS
8
9
6.
A solicitation of proxies for an annual meeting must be free of materially false and
10
misleading statements as required by AS 45.55.160. According to 3 AAC 08.315, a
11
misrepresentation includes' a statement that, at the time and under the circumstances in
12
which it is made (1) is false or misleading with respect to a material fact; (2) omits a
13
material fact necessary in order to make a statement made in the solicitation not false or
14
misleading. "" ""A misrepresentation is material if there is substantial likelihood that a
15
reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.'
16
7. The regulations at 3 AAC 08.355(6) require that a proxy statement include a
17
brief description of all legal proceedings to which each participant in the solicitation is a
18
party with interests adverse to the corporation... The Respondent disclosed the
19
outstanding litigation in which he was involved; but described it as ""regarding failure of CAC
20
to provide a shareholder list in a timely fashion."" At the time the Respondent disseminated
21
his proxy materials, this issue was no longer part of the referenced lawsuit because the
22
court had previously ruled in August 2006 that CAC did produce the list in a timely fashion.
23
The division finds that the Respondent violated 3 AAC 08.315 by making a material
24
misrepresentation in describing the stipulated matter of the lawsuit.
25
ALASKA ORDER #07-01 S
Page 2
1
8. The regulations at 3 AAC 08.355 state that a non-board proxy solicitation must
2
be preceded or accompanied by a dated, written proxy statement.. They also require the
3
disclosure of who will bear the expenses and the amount already spent on the solicitation
4
of proxies. A"" statement indicating whether reimbursement for solicitation expenses will
5
be sought from the corporation"" is also required.
6
9. The Respondent's proxy statement is undated. The division finds that the
7
Respondent violated 3 AAC 08.355 by failing to date his proxy statement.
8
10. Respondent's proxy statement failed to state the amount already expended on his
9
proxy solicitation. The division finds that he violated 3 AAC 08.355(8).

A person may not, in a document filed with the administrator or in a proceeding under this chapter,

14
are made, not misleading.
15
Sec. 45.55.920. Orders, injunctions, and civil penalties.
(a) If it appears to the administrator that a person has engaged or is about to engage in an act or
16
practice in violation of a provision of this chapter or regulation or order under this chapter, the
administrator may
(1) in the public interest or for the protection of investors, issue an order
17
(A) directing the person to cease and desist from continuing the act or practice;
(B) directing the person, for a period not to exceed three years, to file the annual reports,

19
working days before a distribution to shareholders; and
(C) voiding the proxies obtained by a person required to file under AS 45.55.139, including
20
their future exercise or actions resulting from their past exercise, if the proxies were solicited by
means of an untrue or misleading statement prohibited under AS 45.55.160; or
21
(2) bring an action in the superior court to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce
compliance with this chapter or regulation or order under this chapter, and upon a proper showing,

22
defendant or the defendant's assets; the court may not require the administrator to post a bond.
(b) The administrator may issue an order against an applicant, registered person, or other person
23
who knowingly or intentionally violates this chapter or a regulation or order of the administrator
under this chapter, imposing a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for a single violation, or not

5
against a person who is a respondent in the order for the amount of the civil penalty levied against
the person. Subject to AS 44.62.570, the filing of the petition for a judgment does not reopen the
6
final order to further substantive review unless the court orders otherwise. A judgment entered
under this subsection may be executed on and levied under in the manner provided in AS 09.35.
7
Sec. 45.55.935. Hearings.

9
for the following:

14
Regulations (Alaska Administrative Code):
3 AAC 08.315 FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS.
15
(a) A solicitation may not be made by means of a proxy statement, proxy, notice of meeting, or
other communication that contains a material misrepresentation. A misrepresentation is a statement
16
that, at the time and under the circumstances in which it is made (1) is false or misleading with
respect to a material fact; (2) omits a material fact necessary in order to make a statement made in
17
the solicitation not false or misleading; or (3) omits a material fact necessary to correct a statement,
in an earlier communication regarding the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject
18
matter, which has become false or misleading. A misrepresentation is material if there is substantia
likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote. A
19
series of statements or omissions that are objectively false or misleading, but which might not be
material misrepresentations if considered separately, might be material misrepresentations if there
20
is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider the series important in
deciding how to vote. Subjective proof that one or more shareholders actually granted a proxy
because of a misrepresentation is not required. The following are some examples of what,
21
depending upon particular facts and circumstances, might be misleading within the meaning of 3
AAC 08.305- -3 AAC 08.365 :
22
(1) predictions as to specific future market values;
(2) material that directly or indirectly impugns character, integrity, or personal reputation, or
23
directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal, or immoral conduct or
associations, without factual foundation;
24
(3) failure to identify a proxy statement, proxy, or other soliciting material so as to distinguish i
clearly from the soliciting material of any other person soliciting for the same meeting or subject
25
matter;
(4) claims made before a meeting regarding the results of a solicitation; and
(5) )regarding the election- directors, failure to disclose the existence of-an agreement or
Pago of c
1
understanding among two or more nominees, proxyholders, or other participants with respect to
voting of proxies, and failure to disclose the material provisions of such an agreement or
2
understanding, in circumstances where such participants appear to solicit proxies independently or
where there is no apparent affiliation among such participants.
3
(b) The fact that a proxy statement, proxy, or other soliciting material has been filed with or
examined by the administrator under AS 45.55.139 is not a finding by the administrator that the
material is accurate or complete or not false or misleading, or that the administrator has passed
4
upon the merits of or approved any statement contained in the solicitation or any matter to be acted
upon by shareholders. No representation to the contrary may be made.
5
(c) The administrator may require a person who has brought to his attention a solicitation which the
person believes contains materially false or misleading statements to explain the reasons for his
6
view in writing.
7

3 AAC 08.930 HEARINGS
24
(a) Setting Hearings. The administrator or his designee will hold hearings under AS 45.55.225 upor
written request by any person aggrieved by any act, threatened act, or failure to act of the
25
administrator or by any report, ruling, or order of the administrator. The administrator or his
designee will, in his discretion, hold hearings upon his own motion, under AS 45.55.225. The writte
--
1
request for hearing must specify the grounds to be relied upon as a basis for the relief requested at
the hearing.
2
(b) Time of Hearing. Upon receipt of written request for a hearing, the administrator will either set
down the matter for hearing within 30 days from the receipt of the request or will issue a written
3
order denying a hearing.
(c) Notice of Hearing. Notice of hearings will be given not less than 10 days in advance to all
persons directly affected by the hearings. The notice of hearing will contain the following:
4
(1) time and place of hearing;
(2) statement of matters to be considered;
5
(3) statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held;
(4) reference to the particular sections of the act or regulations involved.
6
(d) Witnesses. Any person who is a party to the hearing before the administrator and who may be
adversely affected by the order of the administrator has the right to have subpoenas issued to any
7
witness on his behalf in accordance with AS 44.62.430 (except that the per diem allowance of (b)(3)
of that section shall be $45 instead of $15). It is the responsibility of the party or his counsel to
8
cause the subpoenas to be timely served.
(e) Right to Counsel. Any person affected by the hearing has the right to appear in person and by
9
counsel; counsel may be present during the giving of evidence, may have a reasonable opportunity
to examine and inspect all documentary evidence, may examine witnesses, and may present
evidence in his client's behalf.
10
(f) Rules of Evidence. The following rules and evidence apply in hearings held under this section:
(1) Oral evidence may be taken only on oath or affirmation.
11
(2) Each party may call and examine witnesses; introduce exhibits; cross-examine opposing
witnesses on matter relevant to the issues, even though that matter was not covered in the direct
12
examination; impeach a witness regardless of which party first called the witness to testify; and
rebut the evidence against himself.
13
(3) If the respondent does not testify in his own behalf, he may be called and examined as if
under cross-examination.
14
(4) The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and
witnesses. Relevant evidence must be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of a
15
common law or statutory rule which makes improper the admission of the evidence over objection
in a civil action. Hearsay evidence may be used to supplement or explain direct evidence but is not
16
sufficient by itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in a civil action.
The rules of privilege are effective to the same extent that they are recognized in a civil action.
17
Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence must be excluded.
(5) Nothing in this section alters the ordinary rules of burden of proof in judicial proceedings in the
18
state.
(g) Transcript of Hearing. A record of all hearings will be made. Upon reasonable request made by
19
any person affected by the hearing, and at that person's expense, a full stenographic record of the
proceedings will be made. When a transcription is made part of the records of the division, any
20
person having a direct interest in it will be furnished with a copy of the stenographic or electronic
record at his expense.
(h) Contents of Record. The record in any hearing will include the following:
21
(1) all pleadings, motions, and intermediate rulings;
(2) all evidence received or considered, including a statement of matters officially noted;
22
(3) questions or offers of proof, objections, and rulings on them;
(4) proposed findings and exceptions;
23
(5) the decision, opinion, report, or order of the administrator or his designee.
(i) Final Orders. A final order will be in writing or stated in the record. A final order will include
24
findings of fact and conclusions of law. All findings of fact will be based exclusively on the evidence
presented and on matters officially noticed. Findings of fact will be accompanied by a concise and
25
explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings. A copy of a final order will be
delivered or mailed to each party affected and to his attorney of record, if any, within 10 days of the
termination of the hearing.
Page c
1
(j) Rehearings.
(1) At the discretion of the administrator, a rehearing will be granted to any aggrieved party if a
2
written request is made for it within 10 days after the final order is mailed to the person entitled to
receive it. In requesting rehearing, the party shall set forth one or more of the following grounds:
(A) newly discovered evidence or newly available evidence relevant to the issues;
3
(B) need for additional evidence to develop the facts essential to proper decision;
(C) probable error committed in the proceeding or in the administrator's decision which would
4
be grounds for reversal on judicial review of the order; or
(D) need for further consideration of the issues and the evidence in the public interest.
5
(2) Nothing in this section prohibits the administrator from rehearing, reopening, or reconsidering
any matter in accordance with other applicable statutory provisions or on the ground of fraud by the
6
prevailing party or of procurement of the order by perjured testimony or fictitious evidence. All
rehearings will be confined to those grounds upon which the rehearing was requested or granted.
7
All orders or decisions resulting from a rehearing will be delivered or mailed to each party affected
and to his attorney of record, if any, within 10 days of the termination of the rehearing.

Beginning in February 2008, the ARS market experienced widespread failed
3
auctions (the ""2008 Auction Failures"").

5.
Common categories of ARS instruments include: auction preferred shares of
5
closed-end funds (""Preferreds""); municipal auction rate certificates (""Municipal ARS""); and
6
student loan-backed auction rate certificates (""Student Loan ARS""). The interest rates paid to
7
ARS holders are intended to be set through a Dutch auction process.
8
6.
The interest rate set at an ARS auction is commonly referred to as the ""clearing
9
rate.""
10
7.
In order to determine the clearing rate, the buy bids are arranged from lowest to
11
highest interest rate (subject to any applicable minimum interest rate). The clearing rate is the
12
lowest interest rate at which all ARS available for sale at the auction can be sold at par value.

Certain DBAB agents misrepresented the characteristics of ARS to clients. Certain
5
DBAB agents told clients that ARS were ""safe and liquid,"" ""cash equivalents,"" and ""just like
6
money markets.""
7
16.
Third-party marketing materials about ARS, which were available to DBAB agents,
8
described certain ARS issues as an ""AAA-rated source of short-term income"" and a ""Cash
9
alternative.""
10
17.
Certain DBAB clients maintained investment policies and objectives designed to
11
place their money in safe and liquid investments.
12
18.
Certain DBAB agents sold ARS to these DBAB clients, despite their investment
13
policies and objectives which sought safe and liquid investments.
14
19.
From approximately September 2003 until February 2008, DBAB categorized ARS
15
under the heading ""Other - Money Market Instruments"" on clients' monthly account statements.
16
20.
ARS, unlike money market instruments, are not short-term investments. In fact,
17
ARS bonds may have maturities as long as 30 years and Preferreds have unlimited maturity.
18
21.
Beginning in 2003, CIB began to underwrite certain Student Loan ARS issues
19
(""CIB SL ARS""). Because CIB had not developed a sales network for those CIB SL ARS, there
20
were instances in which several CIB SL ARS issues were not successfully sold to institutions
21
during the initial offering. As a consequence, CIB purchased and maintained on its books 100
22
percent of the outstanding ARS for several CIB SL ARS issues, which ultimately allowed the
23
initial offerings for these issues to succeed. Despite this, CIB continued to market those CIB SL
24
ARS to investors. Some of those CIB SL ARS remained on CIB's books as of the 2008 Auction

Failures.
2
22.
Because certain DBSI agents misrepresented the characteristics of ARS to clients
3
and purchased ARS for clients based upon those misrepresentations, DBSI engaged in dishonest
4
and unethical conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction
5
rate securities.
6
23.
By failing to: (i) provide adequate training to agents concerning ARS, (ii) create
7
and maintain adequate written supervisory procedures concerning ARS, and (iii) ensure accurate
8
disclosure of ARS characteristics to clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise its
9
agents with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities.
10
Conflict of Interest
11
24.
DBAB failed to adequately disclose to clients who purchased ARS that the firm's
12
roles as underwriter and broker-dealer in certain ARS issues were a conflict of interest, and this
13
conflict may affect the auction clearing rate. As the underwriter and lead manager on four
14
Preferred issues since 1992 1 (the ""DBAB Managed Preferred""), it was in the interest of the firm to
15
keep the clearing rates low for issuers of the DBAB Managed Preferred. As broker-dealer, the
16
firm had a duty to provide the highest available ARS clearing rates to its clients.
17
25.
DBAB issued a ""price talk"" document prior to each ARS auction in which it acted
18
as a broker-dealer. This document detailed the interest rate at which DBAB believed the ARS
19
would clear at auction. DBAB determined this rate by utilizing different factors, including the
20
competing interests of both investors and issuers.
21
26.
By failing to fully inform clients about the effect of DBAB's conflicting roles, as
22
underwriter and broker-dealer of ARS issues, on auction clearing rates, DBSI engaged in dishonest

27.
By failing to ensure adequate disclosure of conflicts of interest concerning ARS to
4
clients by its agents, DBSI failed to reasonably supervise its agents with respect to the marketing
5
and sale of auction rate securities.
6
Supporting Bids
7
28.
In every auction for the DBAB Managed Preferred, the firm submitted ""supporting
8
bids"" for its own account that were sufficient to cover the entire allotment of each DBAB Managed
9
Preferred issue. These supporting bids were customary among lead managers to prevent failed
10
auctions and to maintain liquidity for investors. In certain instances, the supporting bids prevented
11
failed auctions, and in others, the supporting bids were unnecessary. However, regardless of the
12
auction outcome, these supporting bids were consistently placed by DBAB, ensuring that
13
successful auctions occurred and liquidity was maintained.
14
29.
DBAB failed to disclose to clients that, in each auction of auction rate preferred
15
issues for which DBAB acted as lead manager, the firm placed supporting bids for the entire
16
allotment of auction rate preferred to ensure a successful auction.
17
30.
DBAB agents were not aware that DBAB placed supporting bids in the auction rate
18
preferred auctions for which DBAB was the lead manager; nor were they aware of the effect of
19
DBAB's supporting bids on those auctions.
20
31.
In or around August 2007, CIB declined to place supporting bids for certain ARS
21
issued by three special purpose vehicles previously created by Deutsche Bank (the ""SPVs"") (called
22
Pivots, Capstans, and Cambers). CIB's decision to stop submitting supporting bids resulted in
23
failed auctions for these ARS issues.

On or around February 13, 2008, the head traders of DBAB's fixed-income trading
2
desk and CIB's asset-backed trading desk, each of which handled the firm's trading in ARS,
3
declined to submit supporting bids for ARS issues in which DBSI was the lead manager. This
4
decision resulted in failed auctions for the ARS issues in which DBSI was a lead underwriter, and
5
a lack of liquidity for clients invested in these issues. Neither DBAB nor CIB has placed a
6
supporting bid since that decision.
7
33.
By engaging in the practice of placing supporting bids to prevent failed ARS
8
auctions and failing to disclose the practice to clients, DBAB engaged in dishonest and unethical
9
conduct in the securities business with respect to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities.
10
34.
By failing to ensure adequate disclosure to clients of DBAB's practice of placing

In connection with: (i) the misrepresentation of ARS to clients, (ii) the failure to
19
adequately disclose to clients the effect of the firm's role as underwriter and broker-dealer for ARS
20
issues, and (iii) the use of supporting bids to artificially prevent failed ARS auctions and failing to
21
adequately disclose the practice to clients, DBSI engaged in dishonest and unethical conduct in the
22
securities business, in violation of AS 45.55.060(a)(7).

12
However, Individual Investors may have requested that DBSI purchase the Eligible

12
DBSI Individual Investor's consequential-damages claim;

15
C. Any DBSI Individual Investors who choose to pursue such claims shall bear

13
(""NASAA Representative"") outlining the efforts in which DBSI has engaged and the results of
14
those efforts with respect to DBSI institutional investors' holdings in auction rate securities. DBSI
15
shall confer with the NASAA Representative no less frequently than quarterly to discuss DBSI's
16

17
Following every quarterly report, the NASAA Representative shall advise DBSI of any concerns
18

Counts 31 - 60 Supervision Required
2
The Division has found that the Respondent has failed to supervise mortgage loan

FINDINGS OF FACT
13
1.
Respondents admit the jurisdiction of the Division, neither admit nor deny the
14
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consent to the entry of this
15
Order by the Division.
16
2.
Beginning in March 2008, the task force began its investigation of Respondents'
17
underwriting, marketing, and sale of ARS.
18
3.
In or about August and September 2007, some ARS auctions experienced failures.
19
These failures were primarily based on credit quality concerns related to the ARS at issue, which
20
often involved underlying assets of collateralized debt obligations.
21
4.
During the fall of 2007 and into the beginning months of 2008, as the default rates
22
on subprime mortgages soared and the market in general began experiencing significant credit
23
tightening, monoline insurers that insured many issuances of ARS were also becoming distressed
24
and were at risk of ratings downgrades.
ITMO: BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC and BANK OF AMERICA INVESTMENT SERVICES, INC.
ORDER NO: 10-11-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 14
1
5.
The result of the overall market conditions in the fall of 2007 and into the beginning
2
of 2008 resulted in increasing concerns regarding market liquidity, as well as a declining demand
3
for ARS.
4
6.
The task force concluded that Respondents should have had knowledge that, during
5
the fall of 2007 and winter of 2008, the auction markets were not functioning properly and were at
6
increased risk for failure.
7
7.
During that time period, significant numbers of buyers had been exiting the market
8
and the continued success of the auctions was reliant upon the lead broker-dealers, such as BAS,
9
making increased support bids. These support bids had the effect of artificially propping up the
10
market and creating the illusion that the auction rate market was functioning as normal.
11
8.
However, during that time, Respondents continued to market and sell ARS without
12
informing customers of the heightened risks associated with holding these securities.
13
9.
Instead, Respondents engaged in a concerted effort to market ARS underwritten by
14
BAS towards its large retail customer accounts without advising the retail customers of any of the
15
potential risks associated with a failed auction or market illiquidity.
16
10.
On or about February 11, 2008, without notifying any of its customers, BAS
17
stopped broadly supporting the auctions for which BAS was lead broker-dealer.
18
11.
The decision left thousands of Respondents' customers stuck holding illiquid ARS.
19
12.
On or about September 10, 2008, Respondents, Bank of America Corporation
20
(""BAC""), and Blue Ridge Investments, L.L.C. (""Blue Ridge"") agreed, in principle, that BAC
21
would cause Blue Ridge to buy back, at par plus accrued but unpaid interest or dividends, ARS for
22
which auctions were in failed mode from ""Eligible Investors,"" which included all individual
23
investors, all charitable organizations with account values up to $25 million and small and medium
24
sized businesses with account values up to $10 million who purchased ARS from Respondents.

9
marketed and sold ARS without adequately informing their customers of the increased risks of
10
illiquidity associated with the product for the time period August 1, 2007, through February 11,
11
2008.
12
3.
As a result, Respondents violated AS 45.55.060(a)(7).
13

Respondents Failed to Supervise Their Agents.
14
4.
As described in the Findings of Fact section above, Respondents failed to properly
15
supervise their agents with respect to the marketing and sale of ARS from October 1, 2007, to
16
February 11, 2008.
17
5.
As a result, Respondents violated AS 45.55.060(b)(1).

sold the Eligible ARS. Any such Eligible Investors identified after December 31, 2008,

C.
Consequential Damages Claims
5
No later than October 10, 2008, Respondents shall make reasonable efforts
6
promptly to notify those Eligible Investors who own Eligible ARS that, pursuant to the
7
terms of the settlement, an independent arbitrator, under the auspices of the Financial
8
Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA""), will be available for the exclusive purpose of
9
arbitrating any Eligible Investor's consequential-damages claim.
10
Respondents shall consent to participate in the North American Securities
11
Administrators Association (""NASAA"") Special Arbitration Procedure (the ""SAP"")
12
established specifically for arbitrating claims arising out of an Eligible Investor's inability
13
to sell Eligible ARS. Respondents shall notify Eligible Investors of the terms of the SAP.
14
Nothing in this Order shall serve to limit or expand any party's rights or obligations as
15
provided under the SAP. Arbitration shall be conducted, at the customer's election, by a
16
single non-industry arbitrator and Respondents will pay all forum and filing fees.
17
Arbitrations asserting consequential damages of less than $1 million will be decided
18
through a single chair-qualified public arbitrator who will be appointed through the FINRA
19
list selection process for single arbitrator cases. In arbitrations where the consequential
20
damages claimed are greater than or equal to $1 million, the parties can, by mutual
21
agreement, expand the panel to include three public arbitrators who will be appointed
22
through FINRA's list procedure.
23
Any Eligible Investors who choose to pursue such claims through the SAP shall
24
bear the burden of proving that they suffered consequential damages and that such damages

ORDER NO: 10-11-S

PAGE 7 OF 14
1
were caused by their inability to access funds invested in Eligible ARS. In the SAP,
2
Respondents shall be able to defend themselves against such claims; provided, however,
3
that Respondents shall not contest liability for the illiquidity of the underlying ARS
4
position or use as part of their defense any decision by an Eligible Investor not to borrow
5
money from Respondents.
6
All customers, including but not limited to Eligible Investors who avail themselves
7
of the relief provided pursuant to this Order, may pursue any remedies against Respondents
8
available under the law. However, Eligible Investors that elect to utilize the SAP are
9
limited to the remedies available in that process and may not bring or pursue a claim
10
relating to Eligible ARS in another forum.
11
d.
Institutional Investors
12
Respondents shall endeavor to work with issuers and other interested parties,
13
including regulatory and governmental entities, to expeditiously and on a best efforts basis
14
provide liquidity solutions for institutional investors that purchased Eligible ARS from
15
Respondents and are not entitled to participate in the buyback under Section III
16
(""Institutional Investors"").
17
Beginning on December 31, 2008, and then quarterly thereafter, Respondents shall
18
submit a written report to a representative specified by NASAA outlining the efforts in
19
which Respondents have engaged and the results of those efforts with respect to
20
Institutional Investors' holdings in Eligible ARS. The written reports will be submitted 20
21
days following the end of the quarter. Respondents shall confer with the representative no
22
less frequently than quarterly to discuss Respondents' progress to date. Such written
23
reports and quarterly meetings shall continue until no later than December 31, 2009.
24
Following every quarterly meeting, the representative shall advise Respondents of any

2
implement to address such concerns.

Relief for Municipal Issuers
4
Respondents shall refund refinancing fees to municipal auction rate issuers that
5
issued such securities through Respondents in the initial primary market between August 1,
6
2007, and February 11, 2008, and refinanced those securities through Respondents after
7
February 11, 2008. Refinancing fees are those fees paid to Respondents in connection with
8
a refinancing and are exclusive of legal fees and any other fees or costs not paid to
9
Respondents in connection with the transaction.
10
f.
Repayment of Interest on Loans Provided To Eligible Investors
11
To the extent that Respondents loaned money to Eligible Investors secured by
12
Eligible ARS, after February 11, 2008, at an interest rate that was higher than that paid on
13
such Eligible ARS, Respondents shall refund the difference to such Eligible Investors.
14
g.
Payments
15
i.
Respondents shall make a total civil payment of FIFTY MILLION
16
($50,000,000) DOLLARS, which shall be allocated among and paid to the

18
territories that enter administrative or civil consent orders approving the terms of
19
the NASAA settlement (together with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the
20

I. JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY

of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by

II. RESPONDENTS

2.
UBS Securities LLC (""UBS Securities"") is a broker-dealer registered with the State

11
III. FACTS AND ALLEGATIONS
12
A.
How UBS Marketed and Sold Its ARS to Its Clients
13
(1.)
UBS Wealth Management's FAs Represented ARS to Clients as Safe, Liquid, Cash
Alternatives to Money-Market Instruments
14
4.
UBS customers in Alaska were sold ARS and, in most instances, were told they
15
were safe, liquid money-market instruments.
16
5.
Many UBS customers were told that the interest rates on these instruments were set
17
periodically through the functioning of deep, liquid, fully functioning auctions that had never
18
failed for 20 years. Some were not told about the auction process at all, but simply thought they
19
were buying short-duration instruments.
20
6.
Many UBS customers were not told that the majority of the auction rate products
21
available to them were limited to ARS that UBS underwrote.
22
7.
Many UBS customers were not apprised of the risks of ARS, including the risk of
23
failed auctions or a market freeze.
24
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 32
1
8.
Many UBS customers were not told that UBS had a policy of placing support bids
2
in every auction for which it was the sole or lead broker-dealer, that UBS routinely intervened in
3
the auction markets to set the interest rates, that certain potential conflicts of interest existed
4
between UBS and its customers, that in August 2007 UBS changed its policy of placing support
5
bids in every auction for which it was lead broker-dealer and allowed some of the ARS it had
6
underwritten to fail, or that after November 2007 UBS was actively considering scenarios that
7
included ceasing its practice of supporting its auctions.
8
9.
After UBS decided to stop supporting its auctions, these clients were informed that
9
the market for these instruments had frozen and that they no longer held liquid short-term
10
instruments but instead held instruments with long or perpetual maturities for which no market
11
existed. Many of those instruments are no longer valued at par on UBS Financial Services account
12
statements.
13
(2.)
UBS Brokers Who Sold ARS to Clients Understood them to be Safe, Liquid Cash
Alternatives or Money-Market Instruments
14
10.
The UBS Financial Services Financial Advisors (""FAs"") that the task force
15
interviewed had not received any specific instruction or compliance training from UBS with
16
respect to ARS.
17
11.
Many of the FAs that the task force interviewed did not have even the most basic
18
understanding of how ARS worked until after UBS pulled out of its auctions in February 2008.
19
(3.)
UBS Did Not Provide Its Financial Advisors With Any Mandatory Training With
20
Respect to ARS
21
12.
UBS did not provide its FAs with mandatory training regarding ARS.
22
13.
In testimony provided to the task force, the Director of Product Management for
23
UBS Financial Services (""Director of Product Management"") indicated a wide range of
24
information that FAs should know prior to selling ARS to customers, including the issuer's
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 3 OF 32
1
identity, the type of ARS, the credit quality, how the auction process works, and that a customer
2
bid may or may not get filled for that auction.
3
14.
However, UBS did not provide mandatory training or specifically instruct its FAs to
4
apprise themselves of this information or provide customers with the information.
5
(4.)
UBS Marketed ARS to Clients as Safe, Liquid Instruments
6
15.
The UBS clients with whom the task force spoke uniformly stated that ARS had
7
been marketed to them as completely liquid, safe money-market type instruments.
8
16.
UBS Financial Services posted on its public website a marketing piece ""Cash &
9
Cash Alternatives Addressing Your Short-Term Needs,"" which included Auction Preferred Stock
10
and Variable-Rate Demand Obligations as a cash alternative.
11
17.
Similarly, in August 2007 UBS circulated its ""Investment Intelligence"" magazine,
12
which is ""a quarterly 'statement stuffer' that is sent to all [UBS Financial Services] retail clients
13
and available to employees on the intranet."" The featured topic was ""Planning Your Retirement
14
Cash Flow Strategy."" The feature included Auction Preferred Stock, Auction Rate Certificates,
15
and Variable-Rate Demand Obligations as cash alternatives. It also invited customers to request a
16
copy of Putting Liquidity to Work: A Guide to Cash Alternatives, which is a brochure UBS made
17
available to Financial Advisors to provide to clients starting in 2004, and which was posted on its
18
external website in October 2007. This brochure identified a number of risks relating to ARS,
19
including the risk of auction failure, UBS's routine support of the auctions, the lack of any
20
obligation that UBS continue to support the market, and the conflicts of interest arising from
21
UBS's multiple roles in the auction market.

ARS Were Listed Under the Heading ""Cash Alternatives / Money Market
Instruments"" on UBS Financial Services Client Statements Through January 2008
23
18.
Through January 2008, the client statements issued to retail customers listed ARS

under the heading: ""Cash Alternatives/Money Market Instruments.""
2
19.
In the February 2008 client statements, UBS removed the heading ""Cash
3
Alternatives/Money Market Instruments"" from its client statements. ARS were then referred to as
4
""Cash Alternatives/Other.""
5
20.
For the May 2008 and subsequent statements, the heading on UBS Financial
6
Services' account statements under which ARS appeared was changed again to ""Fixed
7
Income/ARS.""
8
21.
Student loan auction rate certificates (""Student Loan ARCS"") had been listed under
9
the heading ""Cash Alternatives/Municipal Securities."" This heading was changed to ""Fixed
10
Income/ARS.""
11
(6.)
UBS Did not Disclose Aspects of Its ARS Program to Its Clients
12
22.
UBS did not have any mandatory disclosures regarding ARS that its FAs were
13
required to make.
14
23.
On this topic, the Director of Product Management testified that FAs were not
15
required by any specific policy to inform clients of the possibility that auctions may fail. He said
16
that he did not believe that FAs were required to inform clients that UBS Securities routinely
17
intervened in the auction markets to prevent failure and to place a ceiling on clearing rates. He
18
also testified that UBS Financial Services' FAs were not informed that UBS Securities inventory
19
of ARS had exceeded the $2.5 billion cap, though FAs would have been able to tell that UBS's
20
inventory was growing rapidly in January and February 2008 through the trading systems available
21
to them.

UBS's ARS Program Was Inconsistent With How It Was Promoted to Clients and

Background on Mechanics of ARS

ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 5 OF 32
1
a.
Dutch Auction Process
2
24.
A Dutch auction is a competitive bidding process used to determine rates of interest
3
on an instrument on each auction date. Bids are submitted to the auction agent by the investors
4
interested in buying or selling their securities. The auction agent matches purchase and sale bids
5
and the winning bid is the highest price (equivalent to the lowest rate) at which the auction clears.
6
At the auction a holder may submit one of the following orders:
7
- Hold Order - the holder wishes to continue to hold a position regardless of
8
rate.
9
- Hold Rate Order or Bid Order - the holder only wishes to continue to hold a
10
position or purchase a new position if the new rate is equal to or higher than a
11
specified rate.
12
- Sell Order - directs the broker-dealer to redeem the position at par regardless
13
of the new rate.
14
b. Types of Auction Rate Securities
15
(i.)
Auction Preferred Shares (""APS"")
16
25.
APS are equity instruments without a stated maturity issued by closed-end funds.
17
They are collateralized by the assets in that fund and typically receive ratings from the major rating
18
agencies. Interest rates are intended to be set in a Dutch auction process with auction cycles
19
typically of 7 or 28 days. Typically, they have a maximum rate above which the interest rate
20
cannot be set in an auction.
21
(ii.)
Municipal Auction Rate Certificates
22
26.
Municipal auction rate certificates (""Municipal ARCS"") are debt instruments
23
(typically municipal bonds) issued by governmental entities with a long-term nominal maturity and
24
a floating interest rate that is intended to be reset through a Dutch auction process. They receive
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 6 OF 32
1
long-term ratings from the major rating agencies and are often backed by monoline insurance.
2
(iii.)
Student Loan-Backed Auction Rate Certificates
3
27.
Student Loan-backed auction rate certificates (""Student Loan ARCS"") are long-
4
term debt instruments issued by trusts that hold student loans. Interest rates are intended to be set
5
in a Dutch auction process, and typically Student Loan ARCS have a maximum rate above which
6
the interest rate cannot be set in an auction. They receive long-term ratings from the major rating
7
agencies.
8
28.
References to ARS herein shall include three separate categories of instruments:
9
APS of closed-end funds, Municipal ARCS, and Student Loan ARCS.
10
(2.)
UBS's ARS Program
11
a. Underwriting
12
29.
UBS Securities was one of the largest underwriters of Municipal ARCS and Student
13
Loan ARCS.
14
30.
UBS Securities was a large underwriter of APS until it ceased underwriting those
15
shares in 2005 or 2006.
16
31.
UBS's compensation for underwriting ARS was typically one percent of the amount
17
underwritten.
18
32.
UBS competed with other investment banks to provide low-cost financing to ARS
19
issuers. Its ability to do so was a key factor in its ability to generate additional ARS underwriting
20
business.
21
b. Broker-Dealer Agreements
22
33.
For the ARS that it underwrote, UBS Securities typically served as a manager of
23
those auctions.
24
34.
UBS Securities often served as lead manager, but sometimes served as co-manager
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 7 OF 32
1
of auctions with other large broker-dealers.
2
35.
UBS Securities' management responsibilities were typically set forth in an
3
agreement called a broker-dealer agreement that it entered into with the issuer.
4
36.
UBS Securities' compensation under those broker-dealer agreements was typically
5
20-25 basis points annualized of the amount managed.
6
37.
UBS Securities shared a portion of its management fee with UBS Financial
7
Services and its Financial Advisors in connection with the sale of ARS to customers of UBS
8
Financial Services.
9
C. Distribution of ARS by UBS Financial Services
10
38.
UBS Financial Services served as the primary distribution source for the ARS that
11
UBS Securities underwrote.
12
39.
Most of the ARS sold to clients of UBS Financial Services came from UBS
13
Securities' ARS program.
14
40.
UBS Financial Services did not do its own due diligence to discern whether
15
particular ARS were quality instruments to be offered to its retail clients.
16
41.
The Director of Product Management testified that since joining UBS Financial
17
Services in 2005, he could not recall any instance in which UBS Financial Services had rejected or
18
declined to distribute to its customers an ARS product underwritten by UBS Securities.
19
42.
FAs received a portion of 25 basis points annualized of the total amount of ARS
20
held by their clients.
21
43.
FAs received no commission for their clients' investments in UBS's standard
22
money-market fund.
23
d. UBS Routinely Placed Support Bids in Order to Prevent Failed Auctions
24
44.
On all of the auctions for which it was the sole or lead broker-dealer, UBS
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 8 OF 32
1
Securities placed support bids to ensure that the auctions would not fail.
2
45.
According to information provided by UBS to the task force, in auctions for APS
3
from January 1, 2006 through February 28, 2008, UBS Securities submitted support bids in 27,069
4
auctions. The support bids were drawn upon in order to prevent a failed auction 13,782 times,
5
which represented 50.9 percent of those auctions.
6
46.
According to information provided by UBS to the task force, in auctions for
7
Municipal ARCS and Student Loan ARCS from January 1, 2006 through February 28, 2008, UBS
8
Securities submitted support bids in 30,367 auctions. The support bids were drawn upon in order
9
to prevent a failed auction 26,023 times, which represented 85.7 percent of those auctions.
10
47.
If UBS had not placed support bids in auctions, UBS's auction rate program would
11
have failed.
12
e.
UBS's Setting of Interest Rates
13
(i.)
Price Talk
14
48.
Prior to every auction for which it was the sole or the lead broker-dealer, UBS
15
engaged in price talk. Price talk consisted of a range of bids that UBS Securities transmitted to
16
UBS Financial Services' FAs indicating where UBS Securities expected the auctions to clear.
17
(ii.)
Setting Interest Rates by Placing Bids
18
49.
UBS influenced ARS interest rates by submitting buy and sell bids from its own
19
inventory.
20
50.
UBS's Short Term Desk frequently set the rate at which the auction would clear.
21
51.
In the fall of 2007, UBS raised the interest rates it set on ARS in part in response to
22
a buildup of inventory of ARS.
23
52.
In contrast to the understanding that retail investors were given that the interests
24
rates on these securities were actually set through the auction process, the Head of Short-Term
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 9 OF 32
1
Trading said, ""We are making pricing decisions based on our ability to attract investors while
2
managing issuer client relationships and will continue to do so in efforts to move securities.""
3
(3.)
In August 2007 UBS Intentionally Allowed Certain of Its Auctions to Fail
4
53.
In August 2007, a number of broker-dealers, including UBS, failed some of their
5
auctions for certain auction products that were issued in private placements relating to the CDO
6
market and certain auction products issued by monoline insurance companies.
7
54.
In August 2007, UBS intentionally allowed to fail the auctions for sixteen (16)
8
CUSIPS.
9
55.
These same auctions continued to fail in the fall of 2007.
10
(4.)
UBS's Inventory of ARS Increased Substantially From August 2007 Through Mid-
February 2008
11
a. Inventory Increased Beyond Cap Imposed by Risk Management
12
56.
UBS's inventory of ARS, which it added to each time it supported an auction that
13
otherwise would have failed, began to increase after the auction failures in August 2007.
14
57.
UBS's risk-control division imposed limits on the amount of auction rate inventory
15
UBS could hold.
16
58.
When the inventory obtained by supporting auctions was reached, the Short-Term
17
Desk had to request from risk-management an increase in that cap.
18
59.
UBS's support of the auctions caused its inventory of ARS to increase even more in
19
2008.
20
b. Pushback from Risk Management
21
60.
In the fall of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, UBS's risk management group was
22
beginning to express concerns about the increase in the buildup of ARS. Risk management
23
expressed these concerns in the context of the short-term desk's repeated requests to take on
24
inventory of ARS above the caps imposed by risk management.

61.
For example, an e-mail dated August 15, 2007, from an employee in the investment
2
bank's risk function (who worked with the investment bank's Chief Risk Officer in the Americas),
3
stated: ""Limited extension [of permission to operate over peak auction rate security inventory
4
limit] granted for one night. There is little tolerance for increased inventory firm wide; please
5
continue to price aggressively to keep inventory down.""
6
(5.)
UBS Attempted to Limit the Buildup of Auction Rate Securities Inventory
7
a. Enhanced Marketing Efforts for ARS
8
62.
As UBS's inventory of ARS began to grow, the Global Head of UBS's Municipal
9
Securities Group led an effort to sell more of that inventory.
10
63.
This effort began in August 2007 and continued until UBS pulled out of the market
11
in February 2008.
12
64.
A concerted marketing effort was made to get the FAs to sell ARS.
13
65.
In early 2008, in response to a substantial decrease in corporate cash demand for
14
ARS, UBS began an education campaign to ensure that FAs understood the true credit quality of
15
the ARS.
16
b. Waivers of Maximum Rates on Student Loan-Backed Auction Rate Certificates
17
66.
The maximum rate at which Student Loan ARCS could reset was too low to
18
compensate investors for the perceived risk of those instruments during the period between August
19
2007 and February 2008. Many APS suffered from a similar flaw.
20
67.
These maximum rates were well known to UBS as UBS Securities had built them
21
into the instruments in order to make them more palatable to their underwriting clients.
22
68.
The maximum rates often allowed the issuers to obtain a higher rating on the
23
product in part because capping the interest rate on the product allowed them to satisfy the cash
24
flow stress-tests of the rating agencies.
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 11 OF 32
1
69.
As investors shied away from ARS after August 2007, UBS's inventory began to
2
grow dramatically and it needed to keep raising interest rates in order to move the paper.
3
70.
However, as those interest rates began to approach the maximum rates on the
4
securities with restrictive maximum rates, UBS began an effort to get its issuer clients to agree to a
5
temporary increase in maximum rates and to seek waivers from the rating agencies in order to
6
allow the interest rates on those instruments to rise to a level where those instruments could clear
7
the market, until the market recovered or UBS could work with issuers to restructure.
8
71.
Those waivers were short-term in nature and many that had been obtained in 2007
9
were set to expire in early 2008.
10
72.
UBS became very concerned that when these waivers expired, these instruments
11
would hit the maximum rate and the rate would reset to a level that would not be appealing to
12
investors, thus requiring UBS to take on even more Student Loan ARCS.
13
73.
In January 2008, UBS continued to seek waivers of the maximum rates from
14
issuers.
15
74.
UBS did not disclose its concerns with respect to maximum rates of Student Loan
16
ARCS to investors.
17
75.
Moreover, UBS's FAs were not aware of issues related to the maximum rate and
18
did not explain them to customers.
19
(6.)
After August 2007, UBS's Concerns Regarding ARS Intensified Causing UBS to
Debate Its Ongoing Role in the Auction Markets
20
76.
After August 2007, there was an ongoing dialogue within UBS as to the condition
21
of the auction markets, with particular emphasis on Student Loan ARCS.
22
77.
In the summer and fall of 2007, UBS began a balance sheet reduction program,
23
which required all divisions, including the short-term desk, to contribute to liquidity creation and
24
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 12 OF 32
1
balance sheet reduction.
2
78.
By early December 2007, it became clear that many institutional buyers were no
3
longer interested in ARS.
4
79.
On December 12, 2007, the Head of Flow, Sales and Trading sent an e-mail to the
5
Global Head of Municipal Securities in which he stated: ""The auction product does not work and
6
we need to use our leverage to force the issuers to confront this problem our options are to resign
7
as remarketing agent or fail or?""
8
80.
Of note, that same day, the Global Head of Municipal Securities sold his remaining
9
personal shares of ARS while continuing to engage in enhanced marketing efforts to clients. He
10
subsequently explained that he made these sales because ""my risk tolerance from a credit
11
perspective was - was something that drove me to want to sell"" ARS.
12
81.
A student loan task force was set up at UBS in mid-December 2007.
13
82.
In addition to the student loan task force, in December 2007, a working group was
14
convened to discuss the broader condition of UBS's ARS program. According to UBS's response
15
to interrogatories propounded by the task force, ""In late 2007, UBS formed a working group that
16
addressed the general market conditions for ARS, as well as UBS' continued role in ARS
17
auctions.""
18
83.
The working group held meetings on December 21, 2007, January 4, 2008, January
19
18, 2009, February 1, 2008 and February 29, 2008.
20
84.
The working group discussed, among other things, the buildup in UBS's inventory
21
of ARS and strategies for exiting the auction markets.
22
(7.)
UBS's Conflicted Role in Serving Underwriting Clients Versus Acting in the Best
Interests of Retail Wealth Management Clients
23
85.
UBS's auction rate program, in which it actively managed to influence the interest
24
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 13 OF 32
1
rates on ARS (which interest rates, in theory, should have been set by auctions), put it in a
2
fundamentally conflicted role.
3
86.
On one hand, as set forth in detail above, UBS often needed to raise interest rates in
4
order for auction paper to clear. On the other hand, if UBS raised interest rates too high, it ran
5
afoul of its underwriter clients, to whom it had promised low-cost financing.
6
87.
Many UBS Financial Services' investors were unaware of this conflict, as it was
7
never disclosed to them.
8
88.
Many retail purchasers of UBS auction rate paper thought that the interest rates
9
were set by the auction markets, not by UBS's setting of the interest rates resulting from its
10
balancing of the needs of its underwriting clients and its need to move the product so that its
11
inventory did not grow too large.
12
89.
This conflict became more acute when the auction markets began to crumble. If
13
UBS did not raise rates enough, there would not be sufficient buying interest and UBS would have
14
to take more auction rate paper onto its books. If UBS raised rates too high, the auction results
15
could significantly increase the cost of financing to UBS's issuer clients.
16
(8.)
UBS Financial Advisors Were Not Apprised of This Back Story
17
90.
As the auction rate market began to show some stress in August 2007, which gained
18
intensity through the end of 2007 and January 2008, many customers were not informed of
19
problems in the ARS market.
20
91.
Up through at least February 8, 2008, and in connection with updates to FAs of
21
events occurring in the auction rate market, FAs were informed as follows:
22
The public auction market continues to clear hundreds of auctions daily, with lead-broker-
dealers frequently bidding to clear auctions where needed. While broker-dealers are not
23
obligated to bid in auctions, we do not have reason to change our current practice when
UBS is lead underwriter. We will continue to monitor developments so that we responsibly
24
serve our clients and shareholders.

92.
This message came one day after the Global Head of Municipal Securities, in a
2
February 7, 2008 e-mail to certain UBS personnel on the topic of whether UBS was contemplating
3
failing auctions, stated, regarding the auction rate market: ""clock ticking-not sustainable.""
4
93.
In stark contrast to the sales of personal holdings of ARS by the Global Head of
5
Municipal Securities in August and December 2007, customers who were kept in the dark about
6
UBS's concern about the viability of the program and UBS's wavering commitment to the
7
program, found themselves stuck.

UBS Failed Its Auctions on February 13, 2008
9
94.
UBS Financial Services' FAs kept selling ARS through February 12, 2008.
10
95.
On February 13, 2008, without prior notice to its customers who had purchased
11
ARS, UBS failed its auctions for ARS.
12

Purchase Procedures.
20
a.
Customers Eligible Under Paragraph V.8. For customers eligible for an offer
21
under Paragraph V.8 who opted in to the relief described in the ARS Settlement
22
Notice:
23
(i)
UBS Offer. UBS shall have offered to purchase their Eligible ARS at par
24
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends/interest during the relevant
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 19 OF 32
1
timeframe specified in Paragraph V.8. These customers may enter a sell
2
order to sell their Eligible ARS at par to UBS at any time during the
3
relevant timeframe.
4
(ii)
Discretionary Sales on Behalf of Customers. Starting on the business
5
day following the date that an Eligible Customer opted in to the relief
6
described in the ARS Settlement Notice, UBS shall be authorized to
7
exercise discretion on such customer's behalf to effect sales or other
8
dispositions of Eligible ARS, including but not limited to secondary
9
sales. UBS shall make customers whole at par (plus any accrued and
10
unpaid dividend/interest) if any such disposition occurs below par. Any
11
such discretion shall be exercised by UBS solely for the purpose of
12
facilitating restructurings, dispositions, or other par solutions for
13
customers. UBS represents that the purpose of this aforementioned
14
discretion is to permit UBS to mitigate potential damages while still
15
returning par to customers. In addition, starting the business day
16
following the date on which an Eligible Customer opted in to the relief
17
described in the ARS Settlement Notice, UBS shall be authorized to
18
exercise reasonable discretion to purchase at par Eligible ARS that are

21
each relevant timeframe set forth in Paragraph V.8, UBS shall provide
22
written notice to those customers eligible under Paragraph V.8 who have
23
not sold their Eligible ARS to UBS. This written notice shall notify the
24
customers about the impending expiration of the relevant timeframe,
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC
ORDER NO: 10-10-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 20 OF 32
1
describe the state of the ARS market at that time, and explain the
2
consequences of failing to sell their ARS to UBS prior to the expiration
3
of the relevant timeframe.
4
b.
Returning ARS to UBS Custody. Because the Eligible ARS must be in UBS
5
custody prior to UBS being able to purchase such ARS, the customer must
6
return the Eligible ARS to UBS's custody before placing an order to sell the
7
Eligible ARS to UBS. To this end, UBS shall use its best efforts to assist
8
customers eligible for relief under this Order who have transferred ARS out of
9
UBS custody in returning Eligible ARS to UBS custody and shall not charge
10
such customers any fees relating to or in connection with the return to UBS or
11
custodianship by UBS of such Eligible ARS.
12
11.
Customer Priority. UBS agrees that it will not take advantage of liquidity solutions
13
for its own inventory without making them available, as soon as practicable, to its customers that
14
opted in to the relief provided pursuant to this Order who hold the same CUSIP(S) of ARS in their
15
accounts. This obligation shall continue until June 30, 2010.
16
12.
Relief for Customers Who Sold Below Par. UBS shall make best efforts to identify
17
any such Eligible Customers who sold Eligible ARS below par between February 13, 2008 and
18
September 15, 2008. By October 31, 2008, UBS shall have paid any Eligible Customer so
19
identified the difference between par and the price at which the customer sold the Eligible ARS,
20
plus reasonable interest thereon. UBS shall promptly pay any such Eligible Customer identified
21
after October 31, 2008.
22
13.
Refund of Refinancing Fees to Municipal Issuers. By June 30, 2009, UBS shall
23
have refunded to municipal issuers underwriting fees each issuer paid to UBS for the refinancing
24
or conversion of ARS that occurred after February 13, 2008, where UBS acted as underwriter for
ITMO: UBS SECURITIES, LLC and UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC

PAGE 21 OF 32

both the primary offering of ARS between August 1, 2007 and February 12, 2008, and the
2
refunding or conversion of the ARS after February 13, 2008.
3
14.
Negative Carry on Prior ARS Loan Programs. With respect to each customer who
4
took out a loan from UBS (directly or indirectly) using the firm's prior ARS loan programs since
5
February 13, 2008, UBS shall promptly reimburse the customer for any excess interest costs
6
associated with such loan when compared to the interest paid on average on the Eligible ARS that
7
are the subject of the loan, plus reasonable interest thereon.
8
15.
Purchase from Certain Additional Customers.
9
a.
Subject to the limitations described in Paragraphs V.15.d.and V.15.e, with
10
respect to former UBS customers who are either individuals; charities,
11
endowments, or foundations with Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3)
12
status; or small businesses (entities with less than $10 million in assets with
13
UBS other than institutional customers who have represented they have total
14
assets of greater than $50 million, or otherwise are determined to have assets
15
greater than $50 million, as of August 8, 2008), and who purchased Eligible
16
ARS at UBS on or after January 1, 2000 and transferred the Eligible ARS from
17
UBS before February 13, 2008 and continue to own the Eligible ARS, UBS
18
shall offer to purchase the customer's Eligible ARS at par plus any accrued and
19
unpaid dividends/interest, provided such customer has contacted or contacts
20
UBS to request that UBS purchase the Eligible ARS.
21
b. Within thirty (30) days of March 4, 2010, UBS shall offer to purchase Eligible
22
ARS from each customer eligible under Paragraph V.15.a who is recorded as
23
having contacted UBS before March 4, 2010.

d. The Eligible ARS must be in UBS custody prior to UBS being able to purchase
4
such ARS under this section. Former customers who are eligible under this
5
section must return the Eligible ARS to their prior UBS account or, in the case

of former accounts that have been purged, to new UBS accounts opened by the
7
customer. UBS shall not charge such customers any fees relating to or in
8
connection with the return to UBS of such Eligible ARS
9
e.
UBS's obligations under Paragraph V.15.a will expire after UBS has purchased
10
Eligible ARS pursuant to Paragraph V.15.a with a total value of $200 million
11
(""The Purchase Obligation""). The Purchase Obligation includes sums paid
to
12
any customer eligible under these provisions as well as any similar provisions
13
with any other state. Customers covered by Paragraph V.15.c. will be prioritized
14
based on date of receipt of claim. The Purchase Obligation also will include any
15
amounts UBS paid to customers covered by Paragraph V.15.a prior to the
16
execution of the Consent Order. Furthermore, UBS's obligation under
17
Paragraph V.15.a will be stayed during any period that the sum paid and/or
18
offered to be paid pursuant to Paragraph V.15.a equals or exceeds $200 million.
19
f.
UBS has indicated that it will require each customer accepting a purchase offer
20
under this Paragraph V.15 to provide UBS with a full release of claims as a
21
condition to UBS's agreement to repurchase. Such requirement will not be
22
construed as a violation of this Order, or as otherwise prohibited by this Order.
23
16.
Best Efforts. Notwithstanding UBS's obligations pursuant to Paragraph V.8.c, UBS
24
shall have used its best efforts to, by December 31, 2009, provide liquidity solutions at par for

ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 24 OF 32

5
defense the customer's decision not to borrow money from UBS prior to
6
September 15, 2008.
7
(iv)
Other Damages. Eligible Customers who elect to use the special

Relief Available, or the terms and provisions specified herein.

20
involving ARS. In connection with such investigations, the Division may not seek remedies

23
and sales of ARS, as such conduct is set forth in this Order.

WHEREAS, RBC Capital Markets Corporation (""RBC""), a subsidiary of Royal Bank of
8
Canada, and formerly known as RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., is doing business as RBC Wealth
9
Management. RBC is a broker-dealer registered with the State of Alaska; and

Coordinated investigations into RBC's activities in connection with RBC's marketing and

14
RBC has advised regulators of its agreement to resolve the investigations relating to its
15
marketing and sale of ARS to certain investors; and
16
RBC agrees, among other things, to reimburse certain purchasers of ARS; and
17
RBC elects to waive permanently any right to a hearing and appeal under the Alaska

with respect to this Consent Order (the ""Order"");

PAGE I OF 13
1
of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by

RBC and its subsidiaries and affiliates including Ferris, Baker Watts, LLC and J.B.

Auction Rate Securities
6
3.
Auction rate securities are long-term bonds issued by municipalities, corporations and
7
student loan companies, or perpetual equity instruments issued by closed end mutual funds, with
8
variable interest rates that reset through a bidding process known as a Dutch auction.
9
4.
At a Dutch auction, bidders generally state the number of auction rate securities they
10
wish to purchase and the minimum interest rate they are willing to accept. Bids are ranked, from
11
lowest to highest, according to the minimum interest rate each bidder is willing to accept. The
12
lowest interest rate required to sell all of the auction rate securities available at auction, known as the
13
""clearing rate,' becomes the rate paid to all holders of that particular security until the next auction.
14
The process is then repeated, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days.
15
5.
When there are not enough orders to purchase all of the auction rate securities being
16
sold, a ""failed"" auction occurs. In the event of a failed auction, investors cannot sell their auction
17
rate securities.
18
6.
As an underwriter of auction rate securities, RBC also acted as the managing broker-
19
dealer for certain issues of auction rate securities. When acting as sole manager, RBC was the only
20
firm that could submit bids into the auction on behalf of its clients and/or other broker-dealers who
21
wanted to buy and/or sell any auction rate securities. When acting as lead manager, RBC was the
22
primary firm that could submit bids into the auction, while other broker-dealers were able to submit
23
orders on behalf of their clients as well. RBC received revenue in connection with auction rate

securities, including an underwriting fee representing a percentage of total issuance and a fee for

managing the auctions.

RBC Made Misrepresentations To Certain Investors In Connection With the Sale of Auetion
4
Rate Securities
5
7.
RBC represented to many of its customers that auction rate securities were highly
6
liquid, safe, cash alternative investments.
7
8.
These representations were misleading as to certain investors. Auction rate securities
8
were in fact different from cash and money market funds. As discussed above, the liquidity of an
9
auction rate security relied on the successful operation of the Dutch auction process. In the event of
10
a failed auction, investors cannot sell their auction rate securities and are stuck holding long-term
11
investments, not cash-equivalent securities. As discussed below, starting in the fall of 2007, the
12
auction rate securities market faced dislocation and an increased risk of failure.
13
9.
Since the inception of the auction market, RBC submitted support bids, purchase
14
orders for the entirety of an auction rate security issue for which it acted as the sole or lead broker.
15
Support bids were RBC proprietary orders that would be filled, in whole or in part, if there was
16
otherwise insufficient demand in an auction. When RBC purchased auction rate securities through
17
support bids, those auction rate securities were then owned by RBC and the holdings were recorded
18
on RBC's balance sheet. For risk management purposes, RBC imposed limits on the amounts of
19
auction rate securities it could hold in inventory.
20
10.
Because many investors could not ascertain how much of an auction was filled
21
through RBC proprietary trades, investors could not determine if auctions were clearing because of
22
normal marketplace demand, or because RBC was making up for the lack of demand through
23
support bids. Generally, investors were also not aware that the auction rate securities market was
24
dependent upon RBC's use of support bids for its operation. While RBC could track its own
ITMO: RBC CAPITAL MARKETS CORPORATION
ORDER NO: 10-16-S
ADMINISTR ATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 3 OF 13
1
inventory as a measure of the supply and demand for auction rate securities, ordinary investors had
2
no comparable ability to assess the operation of the market. There was no way for investors to
3
monitor supply and demand in the market or to assess when broker-dealers might decide to stop
4
supporting the market, which could cause its collapse.
5
By the Fall of 2007, the Auction Rate Securities Market Faced Dislocation
6
11.
In August 2007, the credit crisis and other deteriorating market conditions strained
7
the auction rate securities market. Some institutional investors withdrew from the market,
8
decreasing demand for auction rate securities.
9
12.
Thc resulting market dislocation should have been evident to RBC. RBC support
10
bids filled the increasing gap in the demand for auction rate securities, sustaining the impression that
11
the market was functioning. As a result, RBC's auction rate securities inventory grew significantly,
12
requiring RBC to raise its risk management limits on its auction rate securities inventory several
13
times.
14
13.
From the fall of 2007 through February of 2008, demand for auction rate securities
15
continued to erode and RBC's auction rate securities inventory reached unprecedented levels. RBC
16
was aware of the increasing strains on the auction rate securities market, increasingly questioned the
17
viability of the auction rate securities market and planned for potential widespread market failure.
18
RBC did not disclose these increasing risks of owning or purchasing auction rate securities to all of
19
its customers.
20
14.
In February 2008, RBC and other firms stopped supporting most auctions. Without
21
the benefit of support bids, much of the auction rate securities market collapsed, leaving investors
22
who had been led to believe that these securities were cash alternative and liquid investments,
23
appropriate for managing short-term cash needs, holding long-term or perpetual securities that could
24
not be sold at par value.

FINDINGS OF FACT
3
1.
CGMI admits the jurisdiction of the Division, neither admits nor denies the Findings
4
of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by
5
the Division.
6
2.
CGMI (which includes Smith Barney, a division of CGMI) has engaged in the sale of
7
ARS in the state of Alaska.
8
Auction Rate Securities
9
3.
ARS as a general term refers to long-term debt or equity instruments tied to short-
10
term interest rates that are reset periodically through an auction process.
11
4.
An ARS auction is regarded as a ""fail"" or ""failed auction"" if there is not a buyer
12
available for every ARS being offered for sale at the auction. In the event of a failed auction, the
13
investors who wished to sell their ARS were unable to do so and would continue to hold the ARS
14
and wait until the next successful auction to liquidate their positions.
15
5.
Beginning in February 2008, the ARS market experienced widespread failed auctions
16
(the ""2008 Auction Failures"").
17
6.
Common categories of ARS instruments include: auction preferred shares of closed-
18
end funds (""Preferreds""); municipal auction rate certificates (""Municipal ARS""); and student loan-
19
backed auction rate certificates (""Student Loan ARS""). The interest rates paid to ARS holders are
20
intended to be set through a Dutch auction process.
21
7.
The interest rate set at an ARS auction is commonly referred to as the ""clearing rate.""
22
8.
In order to determine the clearing rate, the buy bids are arranged from lowest to
23
highest interest rate (subject to any applicable minimum interest rate). The clearing rate is the
24
lowest interest rate at which all ARS available for sale at the auction can be sold at par value.

CGMI's Activities in the ARS Market
2
9.
Trading of ARS at CGMI is performed by the Short-Term Tax-Exempt Sales and
3
Trading Desk (""Auction Desk"").
4
10.
CGMI's Auction Desk includes traders and sales coordinators. The sales coordinators
5
on the Auction Desk at times provided information to, and answered questions from, CGMI's
6
financial advisers regarding ARS.
7
11.
For approximately twenty (20) years, CGMI has been an underwriter of ARS. The
8
compensation earned for underwriting activities of Preferreds is typically one percent (1%) of the
9
outstanding amount of the ARS underwritten. Since the late 1990s, the compensation for
10
underwriting other types of ARS has generally been a fraction of one percent (.25% to .35%) of the
11
outstanding amount of ARS underwritten.
12
12.
CGMI's ARS underwriting activities are primarily handled by investment bankers.
13
The Auction Desk often consulted the investment bankers with respect to various ARS matters.
14
13.
The cost of the financing to issuers is directly related to the clearing rates set at the
15
auctions for the issuer's ARS. As an underwriter, CGMI had an interest in providing low-cost
16
financing to the issuers of the ARS that it underwrote because its ability to provide low-cost
17
financing affected the possibility of additional underwriting business.
18
14.
CGMI typically served as a manager of ARS auctions. CGMI's roles for each auction
19
were typically set forth in a broker-dealer agreement entered into between CGMI and the ARS
20
issuer.
21
15.
CGMI often served as the sole manager of ARS auctions or as the co-manager of
22
auctions with other large broker-dealers.
23
16.
CGMI's compensation for serving as an ARS auction manager is typically 25 basis
24
points (annualized) of the ARS amount that CGMI sold to its clients.

If CGMI was either a sole or co-manager for an ARS, it may also have been

designated as the lead or senior manager for the entire offering or for specific tranches of the ARS
3
offering.

Prior to February 2008, CGMI's practice was to submit cover or support bids in all
5
auctions for which it was the lead broker-dealer.
6
19.
CGMI placed support bids to: (1) prevent failed auctions and (2) prevent an auction
7
from clearing at a rate that CGMI believed did not reflect the market for the particular ARS being
8
auctioned.
9
20.
For auctions where CGMI was designated a lead manager, it regularly placed support
10
bids for the entire amount of ARS for which CGMI was designated the lead. These support bids
11
ensured that there were enough buyers for every ARS available for sale at the auctions, and as a
12
result, the auctions would not fail.
13
Marketing and Listing of ARS
14
21.
Prior to the 2008 Auction Failures, CGMI marketed the following statement to its
15
clients: ""To date, CGMI, as lead manager, has never been involved in a failed auction.""
16
22.
CGMI and CGMI personnel marketed and sold ARS to investors in Alaska as money-
17
market alternatives, cash equivalents, and/or liquid investments.
18
23.
From on or about August 30, 2006, to until on or about April 10, 2008, CGMI stated
19
on its website that ""[f]rom an investor's perspective, and subject to the conditions discussed in more
20
detail below [including the risk of a failed auction and liquidity risk], ARS are generally viewed as
21
an alternative to money market funds.""
22
24.
ARS are characterized on customer account statements according to the type of
23
security. Until March 2008, CGMT's account statements listed Preferreds under a heading of
24
""Money market and auction instruments.""

25.
Since approximately 2004, CGMI has prepared and provided a document titled
2
""Portfolio Review"" (also formally called ""Private Client Monitor"") to its clients. The Portfolio
3
Review provides a snapshot of client accounts and is a way for CGMI's clients to review their asset
4
allocations and historical performance.
5
26.
The asset classes under which ARS are listed on the Portfolio Review include: (1)
6
""Cash"" (if the ARS reset period is seven days or less, i.e., floaters) and (2) ""Cash Equivalents.'
7
27.
CGMI did not provide its financial advisers with the training and information
8
necessary to explain adequately ARS products or the mechanics of the auction process to CGMI's
9
clients.
10
ARS Market from August 2007 to February 2008
11
28.
In or about August and September 2007, some ARS auctions managed by other
12
broker-dealers experienced failures (the ""2007 Auction Failures""). These failures were primarily
13
based on credit quality concerns related to the ARS at issue.
14
29.
As a result of the 2007 Auction Failures and other market conditions, the ARS market
15
began to see decreases in demand for ARS. Based on the decreasing demand, CGMI accumulated
16
an increasing amount of ARS in its inventory because a higher number of CGMI's support bids were
17
being filled.
18
30.
Another effect of the decreasing demand in the ARS market was a general increase in
19
the clearing rates. Given the increase in clearing rates, some ARS issuers contacted CGMI's
20
investment bankers to express their complaints with the cost of their financing and threatened to take
21
future underwriting business to other firms.
22
31.
Because of the significant increase in CGMI's ARS inventory, CGMI personnel
23
began to discuss the possibility that there might come a time when CGMI could no longer support
24
the auctions. These discussions started in or about August 2007 and continued until the 2008
ITMO: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC.
ORDER NO.: 10-02-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 5 OF 17

Auction Failures. During this time, CGMI understood that its withdrawal from the ARS market
2
would result in some auction failures and the illiquidity of ARS held by its clients.
3
32.
Throughout the fall of 2007, CGMI advised some ARS issuers to refinance their ARS
4
into other types of financing such as variable rate demand obligations.
5
33.
Despite its advice to ARS issuers, on or about November 8, 2007, CGMI increased
6
the sales credit paid to Smith Barney Financial Advisers in connection with the sale of 7-day
7
Municipal ARS.
8
34.
CGMI's internal reasons for the increased sales credit included: (1) ""move increasing
9
inventory""; (2) make ""the product more attractive relative to other options""; (3) ""greater pressure on
10
our balance sheet""; and (4) ""greater pressure from issuers concerning execution versus competitors.""
11
35.
On February 11, 2008, CGMI did not place any support bids in auctions for Student
12
Loan ARS. As a result, on that date all of the Student Loan ARS auctions where CGMI was
13
designated the lead manager failed.
14
36.
After February 11, 2008, CGMI no longer continued to place support bids on all ARS
15
for which it was designated the lead manager. Subsequently, many auctions then failed, resulting in
16
the illiquidity of billions of dollars invested in ARS.
17
Auction Desk Tapes
18
37.
CGMI recorded the Auction Desk's phone calls. These calls sometimes included
19
conversations with issuers, other CGMI personnel, and institutional investor clients.
20
38.
After a tape was fully recorded, it would be catalogued and maintained for a period of
21
ninety (90) days. Following this 90-day period, the tape would be placed in a pool of tapes available
22
for re-recording. CGMI represents that recycled tapes were randomly selected from the available
23
pool for re-recording.

On or about April 17, 2008, the Texas State Securities Board (""TSSB"") requested
2
documentary evidence related to ARS for the period from January 1, 2007 through April 17, 2008,
3
including tape recordings, from CGMI.
4
40.
On or about July 2, 2008, CGMI informed the TSSB that certain tapes of the Auction
5
Desk for the period from mid-October 2007 through February 13, 2008, had been overwritten
6
pursuant to CGMI's represented tape recycling process. Upon discovery of the issue, CGMI
7
promptly requested the suspension of the recycling of the Auction Desk tapes. CGMI represents that
8
it subsequently determined that only one of the nine tapes for the period July 13, 2007, through
9
July 2, 2008, had in fact been overwritten.
10
41.
As of July 2, 2008, CGMI had not overwritten the tapes for the period from July 13,
11
2007, through December 17, 2007, and for the period from February 14, 2008, through July 2, 2008.
12
42.
CGMI failed to take adequate steps to secure one tape of the Auction Desk.

Customers who avail themselves of the relief provided pursuant to this Order, may pursue any
13
remedies against CGMI available under the law. However, those customers that elect to utilize the

STATEMENT OF FACTS
10
A.
Background Mechanics of Auction Rate Securities.
11
1.
ARS as a general term refers to long-term debt or equity instruments tied to short-
12
term interest rates that are reset periodically through an auction process.
13
2.
At auction, ARS always trade at par, with the yield of the instruments being
14
adjusted by the movements of interest rates set by the Dutch auction.
15
3.
In the Dutch auction, a security holder had three options, the holder could: (1) hold;
16
(2) purchase or sell; or (3) purchase and hold at rate.
17
4.
Investors looking to acquire ARS bid into the auction at the rate and quantity that
18
they were willing to hold the securities.
19
5.
Orders for the available quantity of ARS are then filled, starting with the lowest bid
20
rate up until all the shares offered for sale in the auction are allocated.
21
6.
The rate at which the final share from the auction is allocated is the clearing rate,
22
and sets the rate to be paid for the entire issue until the next auction.
23
7.
If there are not enough purchasers the auction fails, no shares change hands, and the
24
rate resets to a rate that is prescribed in the instrument's offering documents.

Merrill Lynch Marketed And Sold Auction Rate Securities As Safe, Liquid
Short-Term Investments.
2
1.
Merrill Lynch Marketed Auction Rate Securities as Safe, Liquid
3
Investments.
4
8.
Merrill Lynch marketed and sold ARS as money market like instruments, which
5
were safe and liquid.
6
9.
Merrill Lynch additionally used research pieces to market ARS to customers.
7
10.
Financial advisers (""FAs"") would often forward Merrill Lynch marketing pieces to
8
customers to reassure them of the safety and value of the instruments.
9
11.
FAs who sold ARS were not required to provide customers with disclosures, instead
10
customers would receive customer's trade confirmations directing customers to where they could
11
access Merrill Lynch's ""Auction Rate Practices and Procedures.""
12
12.
On March 15, 2006, Merrill Lynch ended its practice of sending ARS purchasers a
13
""Master Purchasers Letter."" The Master Purchasers Letter was a disclosure document that all
14
purchasers of ARS had been required to sign and return to Merrill Lynch.
15
13.
Merrill Lynch's policies and procedures did disclose some important elements of its
16
ARS program, including that Merrill Lynch plays multiple roles in the ARS market, that Merrill
17
Lynch's interest may differ from those of its clients who purchased ARS, that Merrill Lynch is
18
permitted but not obligated to submit orders for its own account and routinely does, and that a
19
purchaser's ability to sell the purchaser's ARS may be limited.
20
14.
Yet, since Merrill Lynch FAs were not required to affirmatively disclose these
21
practices prior to selling a client ARS, purchasers were largely unaware of Merrill Lynch's
22
practices in supporting its ARS program.
23
15.
Merrill Lynch did not undertake any analysis of whether any customers actually
24
went to the website discussing its practices and procedures to review them.

2.
Merrill Used Triple-A Rating as a Selling Point for Auction Rate Securities
Even After it had Allowed to Fail Certain Triple-A Rated Auction Rate
2
Securities.
3
16.
The fact that its ARS carried a AAA rating was an important marketing point for
4
Merrill Lynch. The AAA rating on ARS was routinely touted in marketing materials, as well as
5
research pieces that discussed ARS and their safety.
6
17.
Marketing materials produced by the ARS desk promoted ARS as follows:
7
Auction Market Securities provide many advantages for investors
8
Large and liquid market with over $306 billion currently outstanding
9
High quality credits with over 92% of the market rated AAA
10
Incremental yield to comparable securities such as commercial paper and
11
money market funds
12
Taxable, tax advantaged and tax exempt investment options
13
18.
A triple-A rating is a long term credit rating.
14
19.
The AAA rating on Merrill Lynch's ARS do not speak to an investor's ability to
15
liquidate the instrument through auction at par.
16
20.
A number of the collateralized debt obligations and other auction rate securities
17
underwritten and offered by Merrill Lynch carried the AAA rating from major rating agencies.
18
21.
In August 2007, as described below, Merrill ceased supporting the auctions of a
19
number of its triple-A rated action rate securities.
20
22.
Those securities became illiquid and subsequently lost most of their market value.
21
23.
Despite the fact that Merrill had failed a number of triple-A auction-rate securities
22
in August 2007, subsequent to August 2007, Merrill continued to use the AAA rating as a selling
23
point for auction rate securities.

Merrill Lynch was aware, yet did not disclose to investors, that certain auction rate
2
securities retained their triple-A rating after their auctions had failed.
3
25.
Merrill Lynch was aware, yet did not disclose to investors, that the triple-A rating
4
did not provide protection against Merrill deciding to no longer support its auction program.
5
26.
Nonetheless, Merrill Lynch relied heavily on the triple-A rating to convince
6
investors the auction rate securities it was selling were safe and principal protected.
7
C.
Merrill Lynch's Auction Rate Securities Program Stands in Contrast to its
Representations to Customers.
8
1.
Merrill Lynch's Auction Rate Program Provided Issuers with Inexpensive
9
Financing and Generated Substantial Fees for Merrill Lynch.
10
27.
Merrill Lynch's ARS program was funded by issuers of ARS, who paid Merrill
11
Lynch fees to underwrite securities and remarket them.
12
28.
The ARS market allowed issuers to achieve long-term financing at short-term rates.
13
29.
The Merrill Lynch ARS program had four branches, an investment bank that
14
underwrote ARS, the ARS desk that acted as a remarketing agent for the securities, a sales force
15
that sold ARS to retail and other clients, and a research division that assisted the ARS desk in
16
placing ARS.
17
30.
The ARS that Merrill Lynch underwrote then sold to its clients consisted of auction
18
preferred shares (""APS""), with perpetual maturity, with dividends that reset every 7 to 35 days at
19
auction, or long-term debt instruments, issued by municipalities and student loan organizations
20
with maturities of 20-40 years with interest rates that reset through the same process.
21
31.
Due to the upward sloping yield curve, issuers of long-term instruments would
22
typically have to pay higher interest rates.
23
24
ITMO: MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED
ORDER NO: 10-12-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 5 OF 24
1
32.
By supporting the auction mechanism, both in its role as a remarketing agent and by
2
purchasing ARS at auction to avoid failures, Merrill Lynch allowed issuers to have long-term
3
financing at short-term rates.
4
33.
Purchasers of ARS were willing to accept short-term rates because they believed
5
they would have access to their principal on short-term notice at the next auction, and they would
6
get a slightly higher rate than a money market fund because they would have to wait until the next
7
auction to access their money.
8
34.
This belief was cultivated by Merrill Lynch and other broker-dealers who used their
9
own capital to ensure auctions did not fail, and generally touted the 20-year track record of very
10
rare failures, and creating the impression with investors that there was a deep liquid market for the
11
securities.
12
35.
Due to the practice of Merrill Lynch and other broker-dealers of placing support
13
bids, for the 20 years prior to August of 2007 there had been only a handful of failed auctions that
14
prevented investors from accessing their principal.
15
2.
Merrill Lynch Generated Significant Fees by Underwriting Auction Rate
Securities with Constrictive Maximum Rates and Selling them to Clients.
16
a.
Merrill Lynch Generated Significant Fees Underwriting Auction
17
Rate Securities and Distributing Them To Clients.
18
36.
The investment bank at Merrill Lynch generated significant fees from underwriting
19
new issuances of ARS. From 2001 through 2008 Merrill Lynch underwrote approximately $13
20
billion of APS, earning $130 million of underwriting fees.
21
37.
In order to help move new issues Merrill Lynch awarded FAs who placed new ARS
22
issues with a placement credits.
23
b.
Merrill Lynch Underwrote Auction Rate Securities With Restrictive
Maximum Rates, Which Allowed The Securities To Achieve AAA
24
Ratings.
ITMO: MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED
ORDER NO: 10-12-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 6 OF 24
1
38.
Upon information and belief 92% of the auction rate securities that Merrill Lynch
2
underwrote received a AAA rating from rating agencies such as Fitch and Moody's, and 97% had
3
ratings of AA or better.
4
39.
AAA ratings from agencies such as Fitch and Moody's signify the rating agencies'
5
assessment that there is a high likelihood that the security will pay interest or dividends as well as
6
principal when due in a timely manner.
7
40.
Maximum rate provisions place a ceiling on the rate of interest at which an auction
8
can clear, and additionally provide the rate the issuer must pay should auctions fail.
9
41.
When evaluating whether an issuer could make payments as due on its ARS, rating
10
agencies would look at the terms of the instrument to determine how much interest it may be
11
obligated to pay. The maximum rate places an absolute cap on the interest or dividend the
12
instrument will pay, restricting its potential obligations, therefore making it easier for the
13
instrument to achieve a AAA rating.
14
42.
Once Merrill Lynch stopped placing support bids in the auctions for which it was
15
the lead broker-dealer, there were auction failures across its program.
16
43.
When auctions fail the rate resets to the maximum rate.
17
44.
The ARS with high maximum rates, typically municipal auction rate certificates
18
(""ARCS"") with maximum rates in the range of 12-15%, have drawn investor interest and have
19
cleared without Merrill Lynch's support.
20
45.
The ARS with low maximum rates, typically taxable and tax-exempt APS with
21
maximum rates in the range of 3-5%, have not drawn investor interest and without Merrill Lynch's
22
support have continued to fail, leaving investors with illiquid instruments.
23
C.
Merrill Lynch Additionally Received Fees To Remarket The
24
Auction Rate Securities It Underwrote.

46.
When Merrill Lynch underwrote an issue of ARS, it typically served as the broker-
2
dealer or remarketing agent for the issue.
3
47.
Merrill Lynch would typically receive a fee of 25 basis points of the value of the
4
ARS for which it acted as remarketing agent.
5
48.
Merrill Lynch would share a portion of this fee with FAs in order to incentivize
6
them to place clients into ARS.
7
49.
Prior to every auction for which Merrill Lynch was the sole or lead broker-dealer,
8
Merrill Lynch would provide ""price talk,"" a range of bids provided to FAs indicating where
9
Merrill Lynch expected auctions to clear.
10
50.
All ARS for which Merrill Lynch acted as sole broker-dealer were placed through
11
Merrill Lynch FAs.
12
51.
Under Merrill Lynch's ARS program, as remarketing agent, the ARS desk had the
13
option but not the obligation to bid in auctions.
14
52.
Until August of 2007 Merrill Lynch had a policy of placing support bids into every
15
auction for which it was sole or lead broker-dealer.
16
53.
In August of 2007 Merrill Lynch withdrew its support for certain CDO-backed
17
ARS.
18
54.
When placing a support bid, Merrill Lynch would bid for the entire notional value
19
of the issue being auctioned, regardless of the size or volume of buy, sell, or hold orders Merrill
20
Lynch had received.
21
55.
By placing support bids for the entire notional value of the issue being auctioned,
22
Merrill Lynch ensured that no auctions in its ARS program would fail.
23
56.
Merrill Lynch often set the rate at which the auctions would clear with its support
24
bids.

For the period of January 3, 2006, through May 27, 2008, 5892 auctions for which
2
Merrill Lynch was the sole lead dealer would have failed but for Merrill Lynch's support bid.
3
58.
Investors were not provided with information about the volume of shares that
4
moved at auction.
5
59.
Investors were not provided with information about the level of support from
6
Merrill lynch that was required to clear the auction.
7

Investors were not informed of how many ARS Merrill Lynch was carrying on its

Auction Rate Securities Inventory Concerns At Merrill Lynch
10
1.
Weakness in the Credit Markets Initiated Inventory Concerns In Summer
11
Of 2007.
12
61.
Beginning in late July 2007, certain negative market influences surrounding
13
collateralized debt obligations (""CDOs"") and collateralized loan obligations (""CLOs"") and a credit
14
crunch began to negatively impact Merrill Lynch's auction market business.
15
62.
As investors began selling these ARS due to concerns about their credit quality
16
(despite the fact that many were triple-A rated), Merrill Lynch purchased ARS into its own
17
inventory to make sure those auctions did not fail.
18
63.
At a certain point, Merrill Lynch decided to limit the amount of inventory of these
19
instruments it was taking on and ceased submitting support bids, thus allowing the auctions to fail.
20
64.
Merrill Lynch FAs began to seek answers to questions concerning ARS as early as
21
August 7, 2007.
22
65.
FAs from all over the United States sent emails and made telephone calls to request
23
information from the Global Markets & Investment Banking staff managing the Merrill Lynch
24
Auction Trading Desk.

PAGE 9 OF 24

66.
The Auction Desk and the Financial Products Group, along with several of the
2
supposedly independent research analysts for closed-end funds and Fixed Income/Cash, organized
3
and participated in Sales Calls during the second and third week of August 2007 in an effort to
4
clear auctions, reduce the rates of important issuers, and maintain a strong interest in ARS among
5
the Merrill Lynch FAs all over the country.
6
2.
Communications With Issuers And Others Expressing Concern About The
Auction Markets.
7
67.
As early as August 3, 2007, senior management of Merrill Lynch was requesting a
8
sample term sheet for AMPS to understand the liquidity and downgrade risk.
9
68.
In August 2007, representatives from major issuers in the closed-end fund
10
investment world were also trying to get a sense of the risks and demand reductions for their
11
preferred shares.
12
69.
None of these growing risks concerning weak demand in the ARS market were
13
disclosed to Merrill Lynch clients during the third quarter of 2007.
14
70.
Upon information and belief, Merrill Lynch began, in late 2007, discussing with
15
issuers, concerns with the auction markets.
16
3.
Merrill Lynch Surpasses Its Inventory Limit In September 2007, As ARS
17
Market Conditions Worsened.
18
71.
In late September, inventory levels rose significantly and the Auction Desk was fast
19
approaching its limit of $1 billion dollars.
20
72.
In addition, Merrill Lynch had certain lenders that provided financing for its
21
inventory of auction rate securities.
22
73.
Those lenders had previously accepted auction rate securities as collateral for the
23
loans.
24

PAGE 10 OF 24

74.
In the Fall of 2007, certain of these lenders became uncomfortable with the liquidity
2
of auction rate securities and ceased accepting them as collateral.
3
75.
Merrill did not inform its retail and other customers, to whom it was marketing
4
auction rate securities as principal protected cash-like instruments, that entities that financed its
5
inventory no longer accepted certain auction rate securities (even some rated AAA) as collateral.
6
E.
Merrill Lynch's Consolidated Effort to Reduce Inventory - A Three Pronged
Approach.
7
1.
Calming Fears, Providing Assurances And Motivating Additional Sales Of
8
Auction Rate Securities Through Sales Calls with FAs.
9
76.
Just after the first hint of investor concern with the auction market, the Auction
10
Desk and Sales and Trading immediately mobilized to stem the tide of negative news. Managers
11
moved quickly to set up sales calls to provide assurances to FAs and to motivate future sales of
12
ARS.
13
77.
In late November and early December, with inventory backing up and reaching new
14
highs at Merrill Lynch, a decision was made to do another national sales call. The formula would
15
be similar to the successful call made previously in August. Auction Desk personnel would be
16
joined by a member or members of the Research Department to reassure and motivate FAs to
17
concentrate on selling Auction Desk inventory.
18
78.
During the call, there was no discussion regarding the risk of any type of auction
19
failure, or the likelihood or possibility that any market dislocation could result in retail customers'
20
cash becoming illiquid.
21
79.
Moreover, there was no discussion about the possibility that Merrill Lynch could
22
decide at any time to stop its support of the auction market or to otherwise withdraw from
23
supporting the auctions that it sole managed or co-managed.

80.
There was no mention of the fact that with the pressures that existed in the credit
2
market since August 2007, any auction failure by any auction dealer could spread contagion to the
3
rest of the market.
4
2.
FA Incentives - Increased Production Credits Sales Drive.
5
81.
At various times during the second half of 2007, Merrill Lynch provided incentives
6
in the form of enhanced production credits as a means of motivating FAs to sell ARS to customers
7
and reduce Merrill Lynch's inventory. Typically, FAs earned 12.5 bps on an annualized basis for
8
investments in ARS. FAs would then earn a percentage of the 12.5 bps according to a payout grid.
9
82.
During periods where enhanced credits were awarded, FAs could earn as much as 8
10
times that amount (or 100 bps) for sales of ARS. Other enhanced payouts could include payouts of
11
25 bps, or 50 bps. Similar to regular production credits earned, FAs enhanced production credits
12
would be applied to the grid resulting in FAs being paid a certain predetermined percentage of the
13
enhanced production credit.
14
3.
Coordination with Research
15
a.
Proactive Involvement From The Supposedly Independent Research
Department To Aid In Sales Efforts.
16
83.
Merrill Lynch's Research Department played a pivotal role in assisting sales of
17
Auction Rate Securities.
18
84.
On at least two occasions during the Fall of 2007, Sales and Trading and the
19
Auction Desk made direct and specific requests for the Research Department to draft favorable
20
research pieces regarding the auction market to assist in Sales.
21
b.
Improper Information Sharing - -Between Research and Sales and
22
Trading.
23
85.
The task force's investigation revealed frequent communications among research,
24
sales, and trading staff.

Merrill Lynch Policy & Procedures Manual (the ""Policies Manual"") employs a so-
2
called ""Chinese Wall,"" which is designed to prevent ""the misuse of material non-public
3
information"" and to prevent ""even the appearance of impropriety.""
4
87.
The ""Chinese Wall"" is designed to ""restrict and monitor the flow of information
5
between the various areas of [Merrill Lynch] such as Global Research, Sales [and] Trading,""
6
among others ""to avoid the misuse of such information and the appearance of impropriety as well
7
as to manage potential conflicts of interest. ""
8
88.
Among those departments that constitute the ""Private Side of the Wall"" include:
9
""Investment Banking, including Global Capital Markets and Financing (Equity Capital Markets
10
and Debt Capital Markets),' and ""other departments or individuals that regularly receive inside
11
information,"" while the Research Division is on the ""Public Side of the Wall.""
12
89.
Among the categories of information that cannot be discussed between Sales or
13
Trading and Research are the levels or amounts of inventory that Merrill Lynch maintained for its
14
own account.
15
90.
Such information was discussed.
16
F.
Improper Influence and Pressure Over Supposedly Independent Research
Personnel.
17
91.
Merrill Lynch permitted its Sales and Trading and Auction Desk personnel to have
18
undue influence over its Research Department regarding its coverage of the auction market.
19
92.
In addition to the direct requests of Sales and Trading and the Auction Desk to
20
Research for positive published material related to the auction market, undue influence was also
21
exercised over the content of the published research reports.
22
93.
Other times, Auction Desk Personnel attempted to directly influence how Research
23
responded to FA questions during sales calls.

year and Merrill Lynch's Auction Desk personnel began to brace for the worst.
4
95.
Likewise, Inventory concerns at Merrill Lynch continued.
5
96.
On January 23, 2008, word began circulating among broker-dealers that Lehman
6
Brothers had a number of auctions fail the previous day.
7
97.
Concerns were not shared with FAs or retail customers.
8
98.
Between the dates February 1, 2008 and February 8, 2008, staff wrote or
9
contributed to approximately three published research pieces, including: Fixed Income Digest,
10
""Preserve Income Lock in Yields""; Fixed Income Digest Supplement, ""Auction Market Securities""
11
and Auction Market Value Sheet, ""Back to Basics In The Auction Market."" Each of these
12
publications continued to recommend that investors should feel confident about the auction
13
market.
14
99.
On or about February 1, 2008, Merrill Lynch's Research Department published a
15
volume of its Fixed Income Digest, entitled ""Preserve Income Lock in Yields."" The cover page
16
included a section entitled ""Preserve Income."" The last sentence of the section provided: ""For
17
funds that investors need to keep liquid, we continue to find the best value in auction market
18
securities."" Inside the research piece, there was a subheading: ""For Cash Holdings: auction market
19
securities,"" which recommended, [n]aturally, most investors need to keep some portion of their
20
portfolios in liquid cash-like instruments. We find auction market securities (AMS) to be better
21
alternative than money funds for these purposes for investors with larger amounts to invest."" The
22
section was followed immediately by another section dedicated to: ""Answering Your Questions

About Auction Market Securities"" which responded to common questions relating to the auction
2
markets at the time.
3
100.
On February 4, 2008, the Research Department re-published the ""Answering
4
Questions"" piece on its own as a supplement to the Fixed Income Digest in part, because of
5
questions the Research Department was getting calls and that FAs were likely having a problem
6
locating the information in the otherwise lengthy February 1, 2008 publication.
7
101. On the evening of February 12, 2008, Merrill Lynch executives decided to cease
8
supporting its auction rate securities program and intentionally allowed the vast majority of their
9
auctions to fail the following day.
10
102.
Merrill Lynch's decision to stop broadly supporting its auction program was made
11
without any real consideration or analysis of its effect on retail and other investors holding the
12
securities.
13
H.
Merrill Lynch Has Marked Down Its Own Inventory of Auction Rate
Securities, But Still has Not Marked Down The Estimated Value Of The
14
Auction Rate Securities On Its Clients' Account Statements.
15
103.
Merrill Lynch has marked down the value of its own inventory of auction rate
16
securities, yet has not marked down the value of those same auction rate securities in its client
17
statements.
18
104.
According to client statements received by the task force, auction rate securities
19
listed on client statements have not been marked down to reflect their illiquidity. Their ""estimated
20
market value"" is still listed as 100 percent of par. Certain of the exact same instruments held by
21
Merrill Lynch in its inventory have been marked down from par.

Consequential Damages Claims. No later than October 1, 2008, Merrill Lynch shall
7
make reasonable efforts promptly to notify those Eligible Investors covered by Section III.5 above

independent arbitrator, under the auspices of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
10
(FINRA), shall be available for the exclusive purpose of arbitrating any Eligible Investor's
11
consequential-damages claim. Merrill Lynch shall consent to participate in the North American
12
Securities Administrators Association's (""NASAA"") Special Arbitration Procedures (the ""SAP"")
13
established specifically for arbitrating any Eligible Investor's consequential damages claim arising
14
from their inability to sell Eligible Auction Rate Securities. Nothing in this Offer shall serve to

limit or expand any party's rights or obligations as provided under the SAP. Arbitration shall be
16
conducted before a single non-industry arbitrator and Merrill Lynch will pay all forum and filing
17
fees.
18
Arbitrations asserting consequential damages of less than $1 million will be decided
19
through a single chair-qualified public arbitrator who will be appointed through the FINRA list
20
selection process for single arbitrator cases. In arbitrations where the consequential damages
21
claimed are greater than or equal to $1 million, the parties can, by mutual agreement, expand the
22
panel to include three public arbitrators who will be appointed through FINRA's list procedure.
23
Any Eligible Investors who choose to pursue such claims through the SAP shall bear the
24
burden of proving that they suffered consequential damages and that such damages were caused by

their inability to access funds invested in Eligible Auction Rate Securities at Merrill Lynch as of
2
February 13, 2008. In the SAP, Merrill Lynch shall be able to defend itself against such claims;
3
provided, however, that: Merrill Lunch shall not contest liability for the illiquidity of the
4
underlying ARS position or use as part of its defense any decision by an Eligible Investor not to
5
borrow money from Merrill Lynch. Special or punitive damages shall not be available in the SAP¹
6
All customers, including but not limited to Eligible Investors who avail themselves of the
7
relief provided pursuant to this Order, may pursue any remedies against Merrill Lynch available
8
under the law. However, Eligible Investors that elect to utilize the SAP are limited to the remedies
9
available in that process and may not bring or pursue a claim relating to Eligible Auction Rate
10
Securities in another forum.
11
12.
Institutional Investors Not Covered By Section III.5. Merrill Lynch shall endeavor
12
to continue to work with issuers and other interested parties, including regulatory and other
13
authorities and industry participants, to expeditiously and on a best efforts basis provide liquidity
14
solutions for investors who purchased Eligible Auction Rate Securities from Merrill Lynch and are
15
not entitled to participate in the buyback described in Section III.5 above (referred to herein as
16
""Institutional Investors"").
17
Beginning January 2, 2009, and then quarterly after that, Merrill Lynch shall submit a
18
written report to a representative specified by NASAA outlining the efforts in which Merrill Lynch
19
has engaged and the results of those efforts with respect to Merrill Lynch Institutional Investors'
20
holdings in Eligible Auction Rate Securities. Merrill Lynch shall confer with the representative no
21
less frequently than quarterly to discuss Merrill Lynch's progress to date. Such quarterly reports
22
shall be submitted within 20 days following the end of each quarter and continue until no later than
23
1
However, it is agreed by the parties that ""consequential damages"" shall have a meaning separate and apart from ""punitive or special damages.""
24
Under no circumstances should this provision be read to mean that a consequential damages claim may not be maintained due to any state law which
may categorize consequential damages as a subset within punitive and/or special damages.

12
14.
No Disqualification. The Order entered pursuant to this Offer hereby waives any
13

14
disqualifications from relying upon the registration exemptions or safe harbor provisions that
15
Merrill Lynch or any of its affiliates may be subject to. The Order entered pursuant to this Offer
16

including, without limitation, any disqualifications from relying upon the registration exemptions

Except as allowed by paragraph 17(b), terminate the investigation by the Division

5
WHEREAS, WFI neither admits nor denies the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law

contained in this Order.
7
NOW, THEREFORE, the Division, as administrator of the Alaska Securities Act, hereby
8
enters this order:
9
I.
FINDINGS OF FACT
10
Background
11
1.
Auction Rate Securities (""ARS"") are long-term bonds issued by municipalities,
12
corporations, and student loan companies, or perpetual equity instruments issued by closed-end
13
mutual funds, with variable interest rates that reset through a bidding process known as a Dutch
14
auction.
15
2.
In a successful Dutch auction, ARS are auctioned at par and bids with successively
16
higher rates are accepted by the auction agent for the issuer until all of the available securities are
17
sold. All ARS are then purchased or sold at the lowest interest rate bid that will result in all ARS
18
placed up for auction being sold. If there are not enough buy orders to purchase all the securities
19
being sold at auction, a failed auction occurs. In the event of an auction failure, the issuer of the
20
ARS pays a default interest rate until the next successful auction. Broker-dealers that served as
21
dealers for the auctions sometimes placed ""support bids"" on their own behalf in order to prevent
22
auction failures.
23
3.
Beginning on or about February 13, 2008, there were not enough purchasers for
24
ARS at many auctions. The broker-dealers that had previously supported the auctions for these
ITMO: WELLS FARGO INVESTMENTS, LLC
ORDER NO: 10-17-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 15
1
securities ceased their practice of bidding to prevent auction failures. As a result, the ARS market
2
experienced widespread failed auctions. ARS purchasers who wished to sell their ARS were
3
forced to continue holding their positions.
4
Marketing of ARS by WFI
5
4.
WFI marketed ARS to some of its customers, including individual customers, small
6
businesses, and non-profit organizations. Since at least 2001, WFI offered Auction Rate Preferred
7
Shares (""ARPS"") through its fixed-income desk. In addition, beginning in 2006, WFI facilitated
8
Auction Rate Debt Securities (""ARDS"") trades for select customers. WFI did not underwrite ARS
9
and did not serve as an auction manager or auction agent.
10
5.
On February 14, 2008, WFI customers nationwide were holding approximately
11
$2.95 billion in ARS in 5,692 accounts.
12
6.
WFI participated in sales of ARS to customers in the state of Alaska. In Alaska,
13
approximately 32 WFI accounts held $14,343.20 in ARS on February 14, 2008.
14
7.
Because of the auction failures described above, certain WFI customers who were
15
holding ARS on February 14, 2008, have been unable to sell their ARS at auction.
16
8.
In connection with the marketing of ARS, WFI failed to adopt policies and
17
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its registered agents recommended ARS only to
18
customers who had stated investment objectives that were consistent with their purchase of ARS.
19
Some WFI registered agents recommended ARS to customers as a liquid, short-term investment.
20
As a result, some WFI customers, who needed short-term access to funds, invested in ARS, even
21
though ARS had long-term maturity dates, or in the case of ARPS, no maturity dates.
22
Failure to Supervise Agents Who Marketed ARS
23
9.
WFI failed to provide adequate supervision and training to its registered agents in
24
connection with the marketing of ARS. Some of WFI's registered agents were not adequately

educated about ARS products. WFI failed to provide timely and comprehensive sales and
2
marketing literature regarding ARS and the mechanics of the auction process.
3
10.
Some WFI registered agents believed that the ARS were safe and were not aware
4
that auctions could fail and that money invested in ARS could become frozen. In part, this was
5
because some WFI registered agents were not aware of significant aspects of the auction rate
6
market.
7
11.
WFI did not establish specific written supervisory procedures for the review of
8
ARS transactions, nor did WFI train supervisory personnel on how to review ARS transactions.
9
II.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
10
The Division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Alaska Securities Act.
11
For the reasons alleged in the Findings of Fact, above, WFI failed to supervise
12
reasonably its registered agents in connection with the marketing of ARS to its customers. Such
13
conduct in relation to ARS violates AS 45.55.060(b)(1).
14
The Division finds the following relief appropriate and in the public interest.
15
III.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

19
not contest liability for the illiquidity of the underlying ARS position, and provided further

23
for herein shall not be eligible for punitive damages, or for any other type of damages other

more in interest on a loan through WFI or its affiliates secured by Eligible ARS than the customer
7
received in interest or dividends from the Eligible ARS during the time the loan was outstanding

4
NOW, THEREFORE, the Division, as administrator of the Alaska Securities Act, hereby
5
enters this Order:
6
I.
RESPONDENT
7
1.
Respondent (CRD #7870) was, at all times material herein, a New York corporation
8
with its principal place of business at 1005 N. Ameritrade Place, Bellevue, Nebraska 68005.
9
II.
FINDINGS OF FACT
10
2.
Paragraph I.1 is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.
11
3.
Respondent is in the business of effecting transactions in securities in Alaska as a
12
""broker-dealer"" within the meaning of the Alaska Securities Act.
13
4.
Respondent has and has had customers (Customers or TD Customers) located
14
across the United States of America, including Alaska.
15
5.
Prior to February 13, 2008, Respondent solicited and sold to TD Customers
16
financial instruments known as auction rate securities (""ARS"") to at least one resident of Alaska.
17
Auction Rate Securities
18
6.
ARS are bonds or preferred stocks that have interest rates or dividend yields that are
19
periodically reset through an auction process, typically every seven (7), twenty-eight (28), or
20
thirty-five (35) days.
21
7.
ARS are usually issued with thirty (30) year maturities, but ARS maturities can
22
range from five years to perpetuity.
23
8.
ARS can be attractive investments to investors because ARS may offer slightly
24
higher yields than various alternative products, including forms of cash alternative products.
ITMO: TD AMERITRADE, INC.
ORDER NO: 10-19-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 17
1
9.
An ARS yield is determined by the periodic auctions (commonly referred to as
2
""Dutch"" auctions) during which ARS are auctioned at par.
3
10.
ARS typically can only be bought or sold at par at one of these periodic Dutch
4
auctions.
5
11.
Under the typical procedures for an ARS auction in effect prior to February 13,
6
2008, an investor, including TD Customers, who wished to purchase ARS at auction, submitted a
7
bid that included the minimum interest or dividend rate that the investor would accept.
8
12.
ARS holders could either choose to keep their securities until the next auction or
9
submit offers to sell their ARS.
10
13.
An auction agent collected all of the bids and offers for a particular auction.
11
14.
The final yield rate at which the ARS were sold was the ""clearing rate"" and the
12
clearing rate applied to that particular ARS until the next auction.
13
15.
Bids with the lowest rate and then successively higher rates were accepted until all
14
ARS sell orders were filled.
15
16.
The clearing rate was the lowest rate bid sufficient to cover all ARS offered for sale
16
in the auction.
17
17.
If there were not enough bids to cover the ARS offered for sale in an auction, then
18
an auction would fail.
19
18.
In a failed auction, investors, including TD Customers, who want to sell, are not
20
able to do so and such investors must hold their ARS until at least the next auction.
21
19.
In the event of a failed auction, an ARS issuer pays the holders a maximum rate or
22
""penalty"" rate, which is either a flat rate or a rate based on a formula set forth in the ARS offering
23
documents.
24
20.
Penalty rates might be higher or lower than the prior clearing rate or market rates on

21.
Due to various market conditions in the early part of 2008, many of the broker-
3
dealers that acted as underwriters of the ARS offerings or as lead managers for the ARS auctions
4
stopped submitting their own bids in support of the ARS auctions.
5
22.
As a result, by February 13, 2008, the ARS market began to experience widespread
6
auction failures, leaving ARS investors, including TD Customers throughout the United States of
7
America, unable to sell their ARS holdings.
8
23.
On February 13, 2008, through the date of this Order, the ARS market has
9
continued to experience widespread failures, making ARS holdings illiquid.
10
24.
Some ARS have been redeemed by their issuers since February 13, 2008, however,
11
thousands of ARS investors, including TD Customers, who currently hold ARS have been unable
12
to sell through the auction process.
13
25.
TD Customers currently hold hundreds of millions of dollars in illiquid ARS that
14
they are unable to sell through the auction process.
15
Respondent's Role in the ARS Market
16
26.
To facilitate the auction process, issuers of ARS selected one or more broker-
17
dealers to underwrite an offering and/or manage an auction process.
18
27.
In many instances, these chosen broker-dealers submitted their own bids to support
19
the ARS auctions and to prevent the auctions from failing.
20
28.
Respondent did not act as an underwriter, manager, or agent for any issuer of ARS.
21
29.
As a distributing or ""downstream"" broker-dealer, Respondent did not submit bids in
22
an effort to support any of the ARS auctions or to prevent them from failing.
23
30.
Respondent also did not hold any significant inventory of ARS in its broker-dealer
24
house account(s).

31.
Respondent acted solely as an agent, both on a solicited and unsolicited basis, for

TD Customers by submitting their bids to purchase and orders to sell ARS.

Respondent received revenue, including fees for acting as an agent for customers in
4
connection with ARS.
5
Respondent's ARS Sales to TD Customers
6
33.
In soliciting TD Customers to purchase ARS prior to the middle of February 2008,
7
Respondent's registered representatives made inaccurate comparisons between ARS and other
8
investments, such as certificates of deposit or money market accounts, telling customers that ARS
9
were similar investments but with a slightly higher yield.
10
34.
In soliciting TD Customers to purchase ARS prior to the middle of February 2008,
11
Respondent's registered representatives also did not accurately characterize the investment nature
12
of ARS since ARS are highly complex securities that are very different from money market funds
13
or certificates of deposit, as evidenced by, among other things, the dependence of ARS on
14
successful auctions for liquidity.
15
35.
Respondent's registered representatives also did not provide customers with
16
adequate and complete disclosures regarding the complexity of the auction process and the risks
17
associated with ARS, including the circumstances under which an auction could fail.
18
36.
Respondent's registered representatives did not adequately disclose to TD
19
Customers that the Customer's ability to liquidate the ARS depended on the willingness of other
20
investors to buy the instruments at an auction.
21
37.
The information described in Paragraphs 34 through 36 was material to TD
22
Customers.
23
38.
Respondent was aware that its registered representatives marketed ARS to
24
customers as liquid and as an alternative to cash, certificates of deposit, or money market funds

WHEREAS, Stifel agrees not to take any action or to make or permit to be made any public
2
statement creating the impression that this Order is without a factual basis. Nothing in this
3
paragraph affects Stifel's: (a) testimonial obligations; (b) right to take legal or factual positions in
4
defense of litigation or in defense of other legal proceedings in which the Division is not a party;
5
or (c) right to make public statements that are factual;
6
NOW, THEREFORE, the Division hereby enters this Order.
7
I.
FINDINGS OF FACT
8
1.
Stifel admits the jurisdiction of the Division for purposes of this Order, neither
9
admits nor denies the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and
10
consents to the entry of this Order by the Division.
11
2.
Auction rate securities are long-term debt or equity instruments that include auction
12
preferred shares of closed-end funds, municipal auction rate bonds, and various asset-backed
13
auction rate bonds (collectively referred to herein as ""ARS""), with variable interest rates that reset
14
through a bidding process known as a Dutch auction.
15
3.
At a Dutch auction, bidders generally state the number of ARS they wish to
16
purchase and the minimum interest rate they are willing to accept. Bids are ranked, from lowest to
17
highest, according to the minimum interest rate each bidder is willing to accept. The lowest
18
interest rate required to sell all of the ARS at auction, known as the ""clearing rate,' becomes the
19
rate paid to all holders of that particular security until the next auction. The process is then
20
repeated, typically every seven, twenty-eight, or thirty-five days.
21
4.
While ARS are all long-term instruments, one significant feature of ARS (which
22
historically provided the potential for short-term liquidity) is the interest/dividend reset through
23
periodic auctions. If an auction is successful (i.e., there are enough buyers for every ARS being
24
offered for sale at the auction), investors are able to exit their positions at the auction. If, however,
ITMO: STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED
ORDER NO: 10-18-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 10
1
auctions ""fail"" (i.e., there are not enough buyers for every ARS being offered for sale), investors
2
are required to hold all or some of their ARS until the next successful auction in order to liquidate
3
their funds.
4
5.
Beginning in February 2008, the ARS market experienced widespread failed
5
auctions.
6
6.
Stifel and its Alaska-registered securities agents (""Registered Agents"") sold ARS to
7
Alaska residents.
8
7.
Stifel's Registered Agents recommended ARS as safe and/or liquid investments,
9
and compared ARS to cash alternatives, such as certificates of deposit or money market accounts.
10
8.
Stifel did not formally train its Registered Agents regarding the risks and features of
11
ARS.
12
9.
A number of Registered Agents did not sufficiently understand, and therefore did
13
not adequately communicate to retail purchasers, the risks and features of ARS.
14
Stifel's Failure to Supervise the Sale of ARS
15
10.
Stifel failed to reasonably supervise its Registered Agents, which is grounds to
16
discipline Stifel under AS 45.55.060(b)(1). Stifel failed to provide reasonable supervision by
17
failing to provide pertinent information and comprehensive training to its Registered Agents and
18
other sales and marketing staff regarding ARS and the mechanics of the auction process.
19
II.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
20
11.
The Division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Alaska Securities Act
21
(the ""Act"").
22
12.
The Division finds Stifel failed to reasonably supervise its Registered Agents in
23
Alaska, and that this conduct constitutes grounds to discipline Stifel under AS 45.55.060(b)(1).
24
13.
The Division finds this Order and the following relief appropriate, in the public
ITMO: STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED

interest, and consistent with the purposes intended by the Act.

III. ORDER
3
On the basis of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Stifel's consent to the entry of
4
this Order,
5
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
6
1.
This Order concludes the investigation by the Division and any other action that the
7
Division could commence under applicable Alaska law on behalf of Alaska as it relates to Stifel,
8
relating to the marketing and sale of auction rate securities. The Division shall refrain from initiating
9
any action against Stifel based upon or related to the conduct set forth in this order. Specifically
10
excluded from and not covered by this paragraph are any claims by the Division arising from or
11
relating to the Order provisions contained herein.
12
2.
This Order is entered into solely for the purpose of resolving the multistate
13
investigation and is not intended to be used for any other purpose.
14
3.
Stifel will CEASE AND DESIST from violating the Alaska Securities Act and will
15
comply with the Act.
16
4.
In accordance with the Consent Order entered against Stifel by the Missouri Office
17
of the Secretary of State dated January 22, 2010, Case No. Ap-10-05 (""Missouri Order""), Stifel has
18
or will retain, at its expense, an outside consultant (""Consultant""). The scope of Consultant's work
19
is to conduct a review and make written recommendations concerning Stifel's supervisory and
20
compliance policies and procedures relating to the product review of nonconventional investments
21
and the training, marketing, and sale of nonconventional investments by Stifel and its Registered
22
Agents throughout Stifel's retail branch office system. Stifel will receive a report prepared by the
23
Consultant describing his or her recommendations and Stifel will provide to the Enforcement
24
Section a copy of such report. Stifel shall authorize the Enforcement Section to share these written
ITMO: STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED

6
Cents ($1,446.25), such amount to be restricted to the following specific use by the Division:

10
12.
If
Stifel defaults in any of its obligations set forth in this Order, the Division may
11
vacate this Order, at its sole discretion, upon ten (10) day notice to Stifel and without opportunity

for administrative hearing or may refer this matter for enforcement as provided in the Alaska

the Alaska Securities Act, Alaska Statutes (""AS"") 45.55, and the Administrative Procedures Act, AS

4
NOW, THEREFORE, the State of Alaska, Department of Commerce, Community, and
5
Economic Development, Division of Banking and Securities (the ""Division""), as administrator of the
6
Alaska Securities Act, hereby enters this Consent Order.
7
I.
FINDINGS OF FACT
8
1.
JPMorgan admits the jurisdiction of the Division, neither admits nor denies the
9
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Consent Order, and consents to the entry
10
of this Consent Order by the Division.
11
2.
Auction rate securities are financial instruments that include auction preferred shares
12
of closed-end funds, municipal auction rate bonds, and student loan-backed auction rate bonds
13
(collectively referred to herein as ""ARS""). While ARS are all long-term instruments, one significant
14
feature of ARS (which historically provided the potential for short-term liquidity) is the
15
interest/dividend reset through periodic auctions. If an auction is successful (i.e., there are enough
16
buyers for every ARS being offered for sale at the auction), investors are able to sell their ARS on a
17
short-term basis. If, however, auctions ""fail"" (i.e., there are not enough buyers for every ARS being
18
offered for sale), investors may be required to hold all or some of their ARS until the next successful
19
auction in order to liquidate their funds.
20
A.
Marketing and Sales of ARS to Investors
21
3.
Although JPMorgan was aware of increasing strains in areas of the ARS market
22
during the approximate six (6) months prior to the mass failure, JPMorgan failed to ensure that all of
23
its registered representatives made appropriate disclosures to customers regarding the nature and
24
risks of auction rate securities. Certain JPMorgan employees stated that auction rate securities were
ITMO: JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.
ORDER NO: 10-13-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 13
1
liquid, safe, short-term investments and did not highlight the risk that, in the event of a failed
2
auction, the securities might become illiquid.
3
4.
JPMorgan used the proprietary name, M-Stars or Municipal Short Term Auction Rate
4
Securities, in marketing ARS. This could have led certain investors to conclude that ARS were
5
short-term instruments. In fact, ARS were not simply short-term"" instruments. For example,
6
certain student loan MSTARS had maturities in the year 2039 and full liquidity was only available at
7
an auction if the auction was successful.
8
5.
Starting in the fall of 2007, demand for certain auction rate securities continued to
9
erode and JPMorgan's auction rate securities inventory grew significantly. JPMorgan did not
10
discuss the increasing risks of owning or purchasing auction rate securities with all of its customers.
11
6.
In February 2008, JPMorgan stopped uniformly supporting auctions for which it
12
acted as the sole or lead broker. Without the benefit of support bids from broker-dealers, the auction
13
rate securities market collapsed, leaving certain investors who had believed that these securities were
14
liquid, safe, short-term investments appropriate for managing short-term cash needs, holding long-
15
term securities that could not be sold at par value.
16
7.
JPMorgan engaged in practices prohibited by the Alaska Securities Act by engaging
17
in prohibited business practices of a dealer pursuant to AS 45.55.060(b)(1).
18
B.
Failure to Supervise Agents who Sold ARS
19
8.
JPMorgan did not provide all its sales or marketing staff with the training and
20
information necessary to adequately explain these products or the mechanics of the auction process
21
to their customers.
22
9.
Not all of JPMorgan's registered associated persons were adequately educated in the
23
ARS products they were selling.
24
10.
JPMorgan failed to reasonably supervise all its employees, by among other things:
ITMO: JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

failing to provide adequate training to all its registered agents regarding ARS
2
by, among other things:
3
i.
failing to provide to all of its registered agents timely and
4
comprehensive sales and marketing literature regarding ARS and the mechanics of the auction
5
process;
6
ii.
failing to provide to all of its registered agents all pertinent
7
information concerning the ARS product;
8
iii.
failing to provide to all of its registered agents all pertinent
9
information regarding the state of the market prior to the mass auction failures in mid-February,
10
2008; and
11
b.
failing to review ARS transactions in accounts of certain customers who
12
needed liquidity; and
13
C.
failing to ensure that all its registered personnel were providing adequate
14
information regarding ARS to its customers.
15
II.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
16
The Division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Alaska Securities Act.
17
11.
As described in the Findings of Fact above, JPMorgan failed to supervise all its
18
agents and employees pursuant to AS 45.55.060(b)(1).
19
12.
As a result, the Division finds this Consent Agreement and the following relief
20
appropriate, in the public interest, and consistent with the Alaska Securities Act.

On the basis of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and JPMorgan's consent to the

entry of this Consent Order,
24
//
ITMO: JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

PAGE 4 OF 13

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
2
1.
JPMorgan neither admits nor denies the Findings of Facts set forth above.
3
2.
Entry of this Consent Order concludes the investigation by the Division and any other
4
action that the Division could commence under applicable Alaska law on behalf of the Division as it
5
relates to JPMorgan, relating to certain sale and marketing of auction rate securities at JPMorgan;
6
provided, however, that excluded from and not covered by this paragraph are any claims by the
7
Division arising from or relating to violations of the provisions contained in this Consent Order.
8
3.
This Consent Order is entered into solely for the purpose of resolving the referenced
9
multistate investigation and is not intended to be used for any other purpose.
10
4.
JPMorgan will CEASE AND DESIST from violating the Alaska Securities Act, and
11
will comply with the Alaska Securities Act.
12
5.
Within ten days of the date of this Consent Order, JPMorgan shall pay the sum of
13
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) to the State of Alaska, such amount to be restricted to the
14
following use by the Division: promoting investor education, investor protection, and compliance
15
with the securities laws. This amount constitutes the State of Alaska's proportionate share of the
16
state settlement amount of $25 Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00).
17
6.
In the event another state securities regulator determines not to accept the
18
recommendation of the NASAA Task Force and does not enter into a settlement with JPMorgan that
19
follows the terms of the Settlement Term Sheet signed by JPMorgan, the North American Securities
20
Administrators' Association, and the state of Florida, Office of Financial Regulation, on August 14,
21

7.
JPMorgan shall comply (and, to the extent the Settlement Term sheet described
2
herein required action to be take prior to the date of this Consent Order, has already complied) with
3
the requirements of the Settlement Term Sheet executed August 14, 2008, which provides:
4
a.
Individual Investors
5
As soon as practicable following the execution of the Settlement Term Sheet,
6
JPMorgan will offer to buy back at par auction rate securities that since February 12, 2008, have not
7
been auctioning from individual investors who purchased those auction rate securities from
8
JPMorgan prior to February 12, 2008 (""Individual Investors""). For purposes of the Settlement,
9
charities and small to medium-sized businesses with account values and household values up to
10
$10 million will also be treated as JPMorgan Individual Investors. The term Individual Investors
11
does not include senior management of JPMorgan and its predecessors and JPMorgan financial
12
advisors/registered representatives.
13
The buybacks will be completed no later than November 12, 2008.
14
JPMorgan will provide notice to customers of the settlement terms and JPMorgan will
15
establish a dedicated telephone assistance line, with appropriate staff, to respond to questions from
16
customers concerning the terms of the settlement.
17
b.
Relief for Investors Who Sold Below Par
18
No later than November 12, 2008, any JPMorgan Individual Investor that JPMorgan
19
can reasonably identify who sold auction rate securities below par between February 12, 2008, and
20
announcement of the Settlement will be paid the difference between par and the price at which the
21
investor sold the auction rate securities.
22
C.
Consequential Damages Claims
23
No later than November 12, 2008, JPMorgan shall notify those JPMorgan clients who
24
own auction rate securities, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement, that a public arbitrator (as

defined by Section 12100(u) of the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedures for Customer Disputes,
2
eff. April 16, 2007), under the auspices of FINRA, will be available for the exclusive purpose of
3
arbitrating any JPMorgan Individual Investor's consequential-damages claim.
4
Arbitration shall be conducted by public arbitrators and JPMorgan will pay all
5
applicable forum and filing fees. Any JPMorgan Individual Investors who choose to pursue such
6
claims shall bear the burden of proving that they suffered consequential damages and that such
7
damages were caused by investors' inability to access funds consisting of investors' auction rate
8
securities holdings at JPMorgan. JPMorgan shall be able to defend itself against such claims;
9
provided, however, that JPMorgan shall not contest in these arbitrations liability related to the sale of
10
auction rate securities. Special or punitive damages shall not be available in the arbitration
11
proceedings.
12
d.
Institutional Investors
13
JPMorgan shall endeavor to continue to work with issuers and other interested
14
parties, including regulatory and governmental entities, to expeditiously provide liquidity solutions
15
for institutional investors not covered by paragraph 7.a. above, that continue to hold auction rate
16
securities purchased from JPMorgan (""Institutional Investors"").
17
Within 45 days of the end of each quarter beginning with a report covering the
18
quarter ended December 31, 2008 (due on February 14, 2009), and continuing through and including
19
a report covering the quarter ended December 31, 2009 (due on February 14, 2010), JPMorgan shall
20
submit a quarterly written report detailing JPMorgan's progress with respect to its obligations
21
pursuant to this Consent Order and outlining the efforts in which JPMorgan has engaged and the
22
results of those efforts with respect to JPMorgan's institutional investors' holdings in auction rate
23
securities. JPMorgan shall confer with William F. Reilly, Bureau Chief, Bureau of Securities
24
Regulation, of the state of Florida, Office of Financial Regulation, as the lead NASAA member on

behalf of all the states, on a quarterly basis to discuss JPMorgan's progress to date. Such quarterly
2
reports and conferences/meetings shall continue until the first quarter of 2010. Following every
3
quarterly meeting, the state of Florida, Office of Financial Regulation, shall advise JPMorgan of any
4
concerns regarding JPMorgan's progress in providing liquidity solutions for Institutional Investors
5
and, in response, JPMorgan shall detail the steps that JPMorgan plans to implement to address such
6
concerns. The reporting or meeting deadlines set forth above may be amended with written
7
permission from the state of Florida, Office of Financial Regulation.
8
e.
Relief for Municipal Issuers
9
JPMorgan shall refund underwriting fees JPMorgan has received from municipal
10
auction rate issuers that issued such securities through JPMorgan in the initial primary market
11
between August 1, 2007, and February 12, 2008, and refinanced those securities through JPMorgan
12
after February 12, 2008, through the date this Consent Order is executed by JPMorgan.
13
f.
In consideration of the Settlement
14
The Division will:
15
i.
Terminate its investigation with respect to JPMorgan's marketing and
16
sale of auction rate securities to Individual Investors defined in paragraph 6.a. above. However,
17
nothing herein limits the ability of the Division in pursuing any investigation relating to any party
18
other than JPMorgan.
19
ii.
Refrain from taking legal action, excluding entry of this Consent
20
Order, against JPMorgan with respect to its institutional investors until November 12, 2008; the
21
Division shall issue continuances of that period as it deems appropriate; and
22
iii.
Accept payment of $50,000.00 as its portion of the above-mentioned

at JPMorgan.

Except in an action by the Division to enforce the obligations of JPMorgan in this
21
Consent Order, this Consent Order may neither be deemed nor used as an admission of or evidence

14
NOW, THEREFORE, the Division enters this Order.

I.
16
FINDINGS OF FACT
17
1.
Wachovia Securities admits the jurisdiction of the Division, and Wachovia Capital
18
Markets consents to the jurisdiction of the Division for purposes of this Order. Wachovia neither
19
admits nor denies the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order and each
20
consents to the entry of this Order by the Division.
21
2.
Auction rate securities are long-term debt or equity instruments that include auction
22
preferred shares of closed-end funds, municipal auction rate bonds, and various asset-backed
23
auction rate bonds (collectively referred to herein as ""ARS""). While ARS are all long-term
24
instruments, one significant feature of ARS (which historically provided the potential for short-
ITMO: WACHOVIA SECURITIES and WACHOVIA CAPITAL MARKETS
ORDER NO: 10-07-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 16
1
term liquidity) is the interest/dividend reset through auctions that occur in varying increments of
2
between 7 and 42 days. If an auction is successful, investors are able to exit the ARS market on a
3
short-term basis. If, however, an auction ""fails,"" investors are required to hold all or some of their
4
ARS until the next successful auction in order to liquidate their funds. Beginning in February
5
2008, the ARS market experienced widespread failed auctions.
6
Marketing and Sales of ARS to Investors
7
3.
In connection with the sale of ARS, some investors state variously that they were
8
told by Wachovia Securities and its registered agents that ARS were:
9
a.
just like cash;
10
b.
same as cash;
11
C.
safe as cash;
12
d.
same as money markets;
13
e.
safe as money markets;
14
f.
cash equivalents;
15
g.
short-term adjustable rate securities;
16
h.
cash alternatives;
17
i.
completely safe;
18
j.
liquid at any time; and/or
19
k.
always liquid at an auction.
20
Although marketed and sold to investors as safe, liquid, cash-like investments, and although the
21
ARS market had, in fact, functioned for more than twenty years with virtually no auction failures,
22
ARS are actually long-term instruments subject to a complex auction process that, upon failure,
23
can lead to illiquidity and lower interest rates.
24
//
ITMO: WACHOVIA SECURITIES and WACHOVIA CAPITAL MARKETS
ORDER NO: 10-07-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 3 OF 16
1
4.
Wachovia Securities further fostered the misconception that ARS were cash-like
2
instruments by providing account portfolio summaries to certain of its customers that listed ARS
3
as ""cash equivalents."" In fact, ARS were not ""cash equivalents"" and full liquidity was only
4
available at an auction if the auction was successful.
5
5.
Although Wachovia Securities sold ARS as conservative, safe, and liquid
6
investments to its investors until February 2008, Wachovia had information that several auctions
7
had failed in August 2007 and early 2008, before the mass failures in February 2008. During this
8
same period of time, Wachovia failed to inform its customers purchasing ARS after such auctions
9
began to fail that certain auctions would have failed had Wachovia or another broker-dealer not
10
entered support bids in those auctions.
11
6.
Although Wachovia knew, or should have known, of the inherent risks and the
12
recent volatility of the ARS market, only minimal information regarding the ARS market was
13
provided to Wachovia Securities' retail ARS customers.
14
7.
Wachovia and its registered securities agents were, or should have been, aware that
15
the ARS market was suffering from increasing failures and liquidity issues, and they should have
16
disclosed those facts to investors who were purchasing auction rates after such issues arose. Based
17
on these facts, Wachovia engaged in dishonest and unethical practices in the marketing and sale of
18
ARS. Pursuant to Alaska Sec. 45.55.025, these practices constitute grounds to revoke Wachovia
19
Securities' registration. These practices included, among other things, the following:
20
a.
Wachovia told some ARS investors purchasing ARS after the market
21
disruptions began to occur that:
22
i.
ARS were cash equivalents;
23
ii.
ARS were completely safe; and/or
24
iii.
ARS were liquid at any time.
ITMO: WACHOVIA SECURITIES and WACHOVIA CAPITAL MARKETS
ORDER NO: 10-07-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 4 OF 16
1
b.
Wachovia was or should have been aware that the market for ARS was
2
becoming illiquid, yet Wachovia Securities continued to market and sell ARS to investors.
3
Temporary Maximum Rate Waiver on Certain ARS
4
8.
The interest rates on ARS are reset periodically through the auction process. In the
5
event that there is insufficient demand for a particular issue and an auction fails, the interest rate
6
resets to a ""maximum rate"" or ""failure rate"" as defined in the offering documents for that particular
7
issue. Typically, this maximum rate would be higher than prevailing market rates in order to
8
compensate ARS holders who are unable to sell their positions and offer an ""incentive"" to induce
9
buyers to return to the market, although in some cases, particularly for student loan auction rates,
10
the maximum rate might be lower than the prevailing rate.
11
9.
In December 2007, with the encouragement of its underwriters, the Missouri Higher
12
Education Loan Authority (""MOHELA"") sought and secured approval to waive its maximum rate
13
for certain issues of ARS. Absent such waivers, the ARS issued by MOHELA would not have
14
been allowed to reset at interest rates high enough to clear auctions.
15
10.
As a result of the maximum rate waivers, certain MOHELA ARS issues reset to a
16
higher rate for a brief period after the waiver was implemented. However, due to a feature of those
17
issues that caps the average interest rate over any given one-year period, the interest rates reset
to
18
0% after the expiration of the waiver period. The ramifications of this maximum rate waiver were
19
not explained to Wachovia Securities' customers who subsequently purchased MOHELA ARS.
20
11.
Wachovia Securities engaged in dishonest and unethical practices by not adequately
21
explaining to individual investors who purchased ARS with maximum rate waivers, among other
22
things, the following:
23
a.
that the ARS interest rates could not be reset at a level that would prevent a
24
failed auction absent the maximum rate waiver; and
ITMO: WACHOVIA SECURITIES and WACHOVIA CAPITAL MARKETS
ORDER NO: 10-07-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 5 OF 16
1
b.
that the high interest rate allowed by the waiver would expire at the end of
2
the waiver period unless extended by the issuer.
3
Pursuant to AS 45.55.025, these practices constitute grounds to revoke Wachovia Securities'
4
registration.
5
Failure To Supervise Agents Who Sold ARS
6
12.
Although ARS are complicated and complex products, Wachovia Securities did not
7
provide its sales or marketing staff with the training and information necessary to adequately
8
explain these products or the mechanics of the auction process to their customers. During the
9
course of investigations, on-the-record statements taken from Wachovia Securities' registered
10
agents demonstrated that these agents lacked a basic understanding of the functionality of the ARS
11
products and the auction rate market.
12
13.
Many of Wachovia Securities' registered agents were not adequately educated in the
13
ARS products they were selling and did not know where to look for information to bolster that
14
knowledge. Wachovia Securities failed to provide timely and comprehensive sales and marketing
15
literature regarding ARS and the mechanics of the auction process. In addition, Wachovia
16
Securities failed to review account portfolio statements sent to its customers to ensure that they
17
reflected accurate information regarding ARS.
18
14.
Wachovia Securities' failure to provide sufficient training and information
19
concerning ARS and the market environment in which they were sold was not limited to one or
20
two agents, and is therefore indicative of Wachovia Securities' failure to ensure that its registered
21
personnel provided adequate information regarding ARS to its customers.
22
15.
Wachovia Securities failed to reasonably supervise its employees, which is grounds
23
for revocation of its registration under AS 45.55.060(b)(1), by:

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
17
16.
The Division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to AS 45.55.
18
17.
The Division finds Wachovia Securities failed to supervise its employees and
19
engaged in dishonest or unethical practices in the securities business, and that this conduct
20
constitutes grounds to revoke Wachovia Securities' registration under AS 45.55.025 and
21
45.55.060(b)(1).
22
18.
The Division finds this order and the following relief appropriate, in the public
23
interest, and consistent with the purposes intended by the Alaska Securities Act.

INTRODUCTION
8
The Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development, Division of Banking and
9
Securities (the division), is responsible for the administration of the Alaska Securities Act (the Act)
10
at AS 45.55 and the regulations adopted under the Act at 3 AAC 08. Having conducted an
11
investigation pursuant to AS 45.55.910(a)(1), the division finds as follows:
12
II.
FACTS
13
1. The Baron Investment Fund Trust (Respondent) is a issuer of a mutual fund registered under
14
the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77r(b)(2))
15
2. On or about August 22, 2007, respondent filed a renewal notice filing with the division for
16
the sale of Baron Small Cap Fund in the state of Alaska. The renewal notice filing was
17
approved by the division on August 22, 2007, under file number 6003-6745.
18
3. On August 27, 2009, the notice filing under file number 6003-6745 expired and was not
19
renewed in accordance with AS 45.55.075(b).
20
4. On or about July 15, 2010, the respondent provided a notice filing for the continued sale of
21
Baron Investment Fund Trust / Baron Small Cap Fund.
22
5.
Respondent continued to offer and conduct sales of the security in the state of Alaska. From
23
the date of expiration of file number 6003-6745 until the date of this Order, Respondent has
24
sold $50,052.70 in securities to Alaska residents.
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-06-S
PAGE 1 OF 3

III.
LEGAL STANDARDS
2
1. AS 45.55.070 requires that a security sold in the state of Alaska must be either registered
3
under AS 45.55, exempted under AS 45.55.900, or a federal covered security.
4
2. AS 45.55.075 restricts a federal covered security that is not otherwise exempt under AS
5
45.55.900, such that it may only be offered for sale or sold if the issuer has filed specific
6
registration or notice filing with the division. For securities subject to 15 U.S.C. 77r(b)(2),
7
an issuer must file a registration statement or notice filing form, a consent to service of
8
process, and an application fee specified in regulation.
9
3. AS 45.55.075(b) requires an issuer who has registered or notice filed its security for offer or
10
sale in this state, must before the expiration of an effective notice filing, file a renewal notice
11
and filing fee as prescribed by the division.
12
4. 3 AAC 08.085 provides the specific requirements for registration of a security subject to 15
13
U.S.C. 77r(b)(2).
14
IV.
FINDINGS
15
1. The division finds the respondent did not file a renewal notification as required in AS
16
45.55.075 or 3 AAC 08.085.
17
2. The division finds the respondent continued to offer and sell securities in the state of Alaska,
18
without proper registration under AS 45.55.070.
19
V.
ORDER AND NOTICE
20
1. Pursuant to AS 45.55.920(c), the division finds the respondent has committed a violation of
21
the Alaska Securities Act as specified above and further finds it is in the public interest to
22
issue this Order.
23
2. Respondent acknowledges the violation of the Alaska Securities Act as specified in this
24
Order.
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-06-S
PAGE 2 OF 3
1
3. Respondent enters into this Order as a means to resolve its outstanding violations, and as a
2
matter of efficiency and the conservation of resources.
3
4. By entering into this Order, respondent agrees to waive its rights of appeal under AS
4
45.55.920.
5
5. Respondent agrees to pay all fees under 3 AAC 08.920(a)(4), for amounts that would have
6
been paid if the respondent had properly filed all renewal filings.
7
6. Respondent agrees to pay a fine under AS 45.55.920(c), in the amount of $500, for violating
8

I.
10
FINDINGS OF FACT
11
1.
Respondent Credit Suisse admits that its conduct in this matter is within the subject
12
matter jurisdiction of the Division and that it is personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
13
Division. Respondent Credit Suisse expressly waives any right to a hearing, the making of
14

15

rights to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge the validity of this Order.
17

18
Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by the
19
Division.
20
DEFINITIONS
21
3.
For the purposes of this Order:
22
(a)
""Auction rate securities"" are long-term debt or equity instruments that
23
include auction rate preferred shares of closed-end funds, municipal auction rate bonds, and
24
various asset-backed auction rate bonds. Some auction rate securities products have maturity dates
ITMO: CREDIT SUISSE SECURITES (USA) LLC
ORDER NO: 10-09-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 18
1
of 20 years or longer; auction rate preferred shares of certain closed-end funds have no maturity
2
date whatsoever. While auction rate securities are all long-term instruments, one significant
3
feature of auction rate securities, which historically provided the potential for short-term liquidity,
4
is that the variable interest rates reset through a bidding process known as a Dutch auction that
5
occurred in varying increments, generally between seven (7) and forty-two (42) days. At a Dutch
6
auction, bidders generally state the number of auction rate securities they wish to purchase and the
7
minimum interest rate they are willing to accept. Bids are then ranked, from lowest to highest,
8
according to the minimum interest rate each bidder is willing to accept. The lowest interest rate
9
required to sell all of the auction rate securities available at auction, known as the ""clearing rate,""
10
becomes the rate paid to all holders of that particular security until the next auction. If an auction
11
is successful, investors wishing to sell are able to exit the auction rate securities market on a short-
12
term basis. When there are not enough orders to purchase all of the auction rate securities being
13
sold, a ""failed"" auction occurs. If an auction fails, investors are required to hold all or some of
14
their auction rate securities until the next successful auction in order to liquidate their funds, or
15
they may attempt to sell those auction rate securities in a secondary market transaction, if such a
16
secondary market even exists and is functioning. Beginning in February 2008, the auction rate
17
securities market experienced widespread and repeated failed auctions.
18
(b)
""Individual Investor"" means any natural person who purchased auction rate
19
securities from or through a Respondent Credit Suisse account prior to February 14, 2008, and also
20
includes
21
(i)
legal entities acting as an investment vehicle for family members,
22
including but not limited to IRA accounts, trusts, family limited partnerships, and
23
other legal entities performing a similar function;
24
(ii)
charities and non-profits; and
ITMO: CREDIT SUISSE SECURITES (USA) LLC

PAGE 3 OF 18

(iii)
small to medium-sized businesses with up to $10 million in assets in
2
accounts with Respondent Credit Suisse, any of which purchased auction rate
3
securities from or through Respondent Credit Suisse prior to February 14, 2008.
4
Notwithstanding any other provision, ""Individual Investor"" does not include a
5
broker-dealer, bank, registered investment adviser, or other investment firm or
6
investment institution regardless of whether any of the foregoing is acting for its
7
own account or as a conduit for its customers.
8
(c)
""Institutional Investor"" means any other legal entity not meeting the
9
definition of ""Individual Investor"" in paragraph I.3(b), above, that purchased auction rate securities
10
from or through a Respondent Credit Suisse account.
11
(d)

EVENTS
19
4.
Respondent Credit Suisse was an underwriter of a limited number of offerings of
20
auction rate securities. Respondent Credit Suisse also acted as a manager for certain issues of
21
auction rate securities. When acting as a sole manager, Respondent Credit Suisse was the only
22
firm that could submit bids into the auction on behalf of its clients and/or other broker-dealers who
23
wanted to buy and/or sell any auction rate securities. When acting as a co-lead manager,
24
Respondent Credit Suisse and the other co-lead managers could directly submit orders into the
ITMO: CREDIT SUISSE SECURITES (USA) LLC
ORDER NO: 10-09-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 4 OF 18
1
auction, while other broker-dealers were able to submit orders on behalf of their clients and on
2
their own behalf into the auction through a co-lead manager. Respondent Credit Suisse received
3
revenue in connection with auction rate securities, including underwriting fees representing a
4
percentage of total issuance and a fee for managing the auctions.
5
5.
From time to time over many years, Respondent Credit Suisse submitted support
6
bids, or purchase orders, for some or all of an auction rate security issue for which it acted as the
7
sole or lead manager. Support bids were Respondent Credit Suisse's proprietary orders that would
8
be filled, in whole or in part, if there were otherwise insufficient demand in an auction. When
9
Respondent Credit Suisse purchased auction rate securities through support bids, those auction rate
10
securities were then owned by Respondent Credit Suisse and were recorded on Respondent Credit
11
Suisse's balance sheet.
12
6.
Because investors could not ascertain how much of an auction was filled through
13
proprietary bids of Respondent Credit Suisse and other firms acting as sole or lead managers, they
14
could not determine if auctions were clearing because of normal marketplace demand, or because
15
Respondent Credit Suisse and other firms acting as lead managers were supporting the auctions
16
through their own proprietary purchase orders. Generally, investors also were not aware of the
17
extent to which the auction rate securities market was dependent upon Respondent Credit Suisse's
18
and other broker-dealers' use of support bids for its successful operation. While Respondent Credit
19
Suisse could track its own inventory as a measure of the supply and demand for auction rate
20
securities for which it was a sole, lead, or co-lead manager, ordinary investors had no comparable
21
ability to assess the operation of the market. There was no way for those investors to monitor
22
supply and demand in the market or to assess when broker-dealers might decide to stop supporting
23
the market, which could cause numerous and repeated auction failures.

7.
In August 2007, the credit crisis and other deteriorating market conditions strained
2
the auction rate securities market. Some institutional investors withdrew from the market,
3
decreasing demand for auction rate securities.
4
8.
The potential for a market dislocation should have been evident to Respondent
5
Credit Suisse. In those auctions where Respondent Credit Suisse was a lead manager, Respondent
6
Credit Suisse's support bids filled the increasing gap between the supply of and the demand for
7
auction rate securities, maintaining the impression that the auction process was functioning. From
8
the fall of 2007 until February 2008, demand for auction rate securities continued to erode and
9
Respondent Credit Suisse's inventory of auction rate securities grew. Respondent Credit Suisse
10
was aware of increasing strains on the auction rate securities market and increasingly questioned
11
the viability of the auction rate securities market. On January 28, 2008, Respondent Credit Suisse
12
provided written disclosure of these increasing risks of owning or purchasing auction rate
13
securities to its customers; prior to that date, certain of its representatives did not fully disclose
14
those increasing risks to certain of their clients.
15
9.
In February 2008, Respondent Credit Suisse and other broker-dealers stopped
16
supporting the auctions. Without the benefit of support bids, the auction rate securities market
17
collapsed, leaving investors who thought they were buying liquid, short-term investments instead
18
holding long-term or perpetual securities that they were unable to sell at par value.
19
10.
In certain instances, Respondent Credit Suisse representatives told certain of the
20
firm's customers that auction rate securities were liquid investments that were alternatives to
21
money market funds as part of a strategy for cash management. Specifically, certain employees
22
acting on behalf of Respondent Credit Suisse represented to certain investors that auction rate
23
securities were highly liquid, highly rated alternatives to money market investments and other
24
cash-equivalent investments.

11.
In the context of the offer and sale of auction rate securities, the failure of certain
2
employees acting on behalf of Respondent Credit Suisse to adequately state complete facts
3
concerning auction rate securities constituted a violation of AS 45.55.025.
4
12.
Respondent Credit Suisse, by failing reasonably to supervise its registered sales
5
force, as described in these Findings of Fact, has violated AS 45.55.060(b).

ACTION NECESSARY TO PROTECT PUBLIC
7
13.
Action by the Division to halt further conduct by Respondent Credit Suisse in
8
violation of the Act is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of
9
investors, and is consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
10
Act.

Respondent Credit Suisse agrees that this Order contains, constitutes, and embodies
12
the entire agreement between the undersigned, there being no agreement of any kind, verbal or
13
otherwise, which varies, alters, or adds to this Order; and that this Order supersedes any prior
14
communication, understanding, or agreement, whether written or oral, concerning the subject

matter of this Order.

Respondent Credit Suisse agrees that the presentation of this Order to the Division
17
without the undersigned Respondent Credit Suisse or any counsel for Respondent Credit Suisse
18

Respondent Credit Suisse, the Division makes the following:

Respondent Credit Suisse engaged in dishonest and unethical practices: By reason

On the basis of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Respondent Credit Suisse's

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
18
1.
This Order terminates the investigation by the Division with respect to Respondent
19
Credit Suisse's marketing and sale of auction rate securities to Individual Investors. However,
20
nothing herein limits the ability of the Division, individually or jointly with other states, in
21
pursuing any investigation with respect to any individual concerning Respondent Credit Suisse's
22
marketing and sale of auction rate securities, whether that individual is associated with Respondent
23
Credit Suisse or otherwise; and specifically excluded from and not covered by this paragraph are
24
any claims by the Division arising from or relating to the Order provisions contained herein.

Respondent Credit Suisse will CEASE AND DESIST from violating the Act and
4

4.
Within ten (10) days following the entry of this Order, by check made payable to

the State of Alaska, Respondent Credit Suisse shall pay the sum of thirty thousand, three hundred
7
seventy-two dollars and 98 cents ($30,372.98), such amount to be restricted to the following
8
specific use by the division: promoting investor education, investor protection, and compliance
9
with the securities laws. This amount constitutes Alaska's allocated share of the $15 million total
10
settlement payment that Respondent Credit Suisse has agreed to make to those states and territories
11
that enter administrative or civil consent orders approving the terms of the NASAA settlement and
12
to the state of New York, allocated according to a formula determined and set by NASAA and the
13
State of New York.
14
5.
In the event another state securities regulator determines not to accept Respondent
15
Credit Suisse's offer of settlement and does not enter an administrative or civil consent order
16
approving the terms of the NASAA settlement, the total amount of the Division's allocated
17
payment shall not be affected, and shall remain at thirty thousand, three hundred seventy-two
18
dollars ($30,372).

Respondent Credit Suisse shall not claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction or tax
20
credit with regard to any state, federal, or local tax for any payment that Respondent Credit Suisse
21
shall make pursuant to this Order.

A.
As soon as practicable after September 23, 2008, Respondent Credit
2
Suisse will have offered to purchase at par auction rate securities that since February 14,
3
2008, have not been successfully auctioning from Individual Investors who purchased
4
those auction rate securities from or through a Respondent Credit Suisse account prior to
5
February 14, 2008;
6
B.
Respondent Credit Suisse shall have purchased such securities from
7
investors who accepted this offer prior to December 11, 2008, by that date;
8
C.
Respondent Credit Suisse shall keep such offer open until
9
December 31, 2009, and promptly shall purchase such securities from any Individual
10
Investor who accepts the offer between December 11, 2008, and December 31, 2009;
11
D.
Respondent Credit Suisse promptly will have provided notice to
12
customers of the settlement terms publicly announced on September 16, 2008, and
13
Respondent Credit Suisse promptly will have established a dedicated telephone assistance
14
line, with appropriate staff, to respond to questions from customers concerning the terms of
15
the settlement;
16
E.
No later than December 11, 2008, any Individual Investor that
17
Respondent Credit Suisse could reasonably identify who sold auction rate securities in a
18
Credit Suisse account below par between February 14, 2008, and September 16, 2008, will
19
have been paid by Respondent Credit Suisse the difference between par and the price at
20
which the Individual Investor sold those auction rate securities;
21
F.
No later than December 11, 2008, Respondent Credit Suisse shall
22
have notified all Individual Investors that a public arbitrator (as defined by section

(""FINRA""), will be available for the exclusive purpose of arbitrating any Individual
2
Investor's consequential damages claim. Arbitration shall be conducted by public
3
arbitrators and Respondent Credit Suisse will pay all applicable forum and filing fees. Any
4
Individual Investors who choose to pursue such claims shall bear the burden of proving that
5
they suffered consequential damages and that such damages were caused by the investors'
6
inability to access funds consisting of investors' auction rate securities holdings in Credit
7
Suisse accounts. Respondent Credit Suisse shall be able to defend itself against such
8
claims; provided, however, that Respondent Credit Suisse shall not contest in these
9
arbitrations liability related to the sale of auction rate securities; and further provided that
10
Respondent Credit Suisse shall not be able to use as part of its defense an Individual
11
Investor's decision not to borrow money from Respondent Credit Suisse. Punitive
12
damages, or any other type of damages other than consequential damages, shall not be
13
available in the arbitration proceedings;
14

15
other interested parties, including regulatory and governmental entities, to expeditiously
16
provide liquidity solutions for Institutional Investors;

H.
Beginning December 11, 2008, and then quarterly after that,
18
Respondent Credit Suisse shall submit a written report to the representative specified by
19
NASAA outlining the efforts in which Respondent Credit Suisse has engaged and the
20
results of those efforts with respect to Respondent Credit Suisse's Institutional Investors'
21
holdings in auction rate securities;

Respondent Credit Suisse shall confer with the representative

3
K.
Following every quarterly report, the representative specified by
4
NASAA will advise Respondent Credit Suisse of any concerns and, in response,
5
Respondent Credit Suisse shall discuss with the representative specified by NASAA how it
6
plans to address such concerns;

L.
Respondent Credit Suisse shall make its best efforts to identify
8
Individual Investors who took out loans from Respondent Credit Suisse, between

February 14, 2008, and December 11, 2008, that were secured by auction rate securities
10
that were not successfully auctioning at the time the loan was taken out from Respondent
11
Credit Suisse, and who paid interest associated with the auction-rate-securities-based
12
portion of those loans in excess of the total interest and dividends received on the auction
13
rate securities during the duration of the loan. Respondent Credit Suisse shall reimburse
14
such customers for the excess expense, plus reasonable interest, of the loan. Such
15
reimbursement shall occur no later than March 31, 2009. This paragraph does not apply to

Respondent Credit Suisse shall, upon request by the Division,

compliance with this Order;

N.
Respondent Credit Suisse shall not take any action, or make or

permit to be made any public statement, denying, directly or indirectly, any finding in this

Order or creating the impression that this Order is without factual basis. Nothing in this

request of the Division, of all documents or other tangible evidence requested by
13
the Division and any compilations or summaries of information or data that the

Division requests that Respondent Credit Suisse (or Respondent Credit Suisse's

(2)
without the necessity of a subpoena, having the current (and making

all reasonable efforts to cause the former) officers, directors, trustees, agents,

all records and other evidence in its possession, custody, or control (or the

8.
The cooperation provisions set forth in paragraph III.7.O, above, is not intended,
18
nor is it a reasonable construction of such provisions, to require Respondent Credit Suisse (or any
19
of its parent companies, subsidiaries, or affiliates, or any of their current or former officers,
20
directors, or employees) to violate any foreign or domestic law or regulation in complying with
21
those provisions. Respondent Credit Suisse shall promptly notify the Division if any request under
22
those cooperation provisions has been construed to require that Respondent Credit Suisse (or any
23
of its parent companies, subsidiaries, or affiliates, or any of their current or former officers,
24
directors, or employees) violate any foreign or domestic law or regulation. In such circumstances,

9.
In consideration of Respondent Credit Suisse's agreement to resolve the previously

referenced multistate investigation relating to its marketing and sales practices for auction rate
5
securities, and its agreement to fully comply with all the terms of this Order, the Division will have
6
refrained from taking legal action against Respondent Credit Suisse with respect to its Institutional

at its sole discretion, upon ten (10) days' notice to Respondent Credit Suisse and without
13
opportunity for administrative hearing, or may refer this matter for enforcement as provided in the

NOW, THEREFORE, the Division, acting under the authority of AS 45.55.010 -
AS 45.55.995, the Alaska Securities Act, (""the Act""), hereby enters this Order:
2
FINDINGS OF FACT
3
Part 1: Respondent Licensing/Registration History
4
1.
Prosper is a Delaware corporation (Delaware Division of Corporations #3943799)
that was incorporated on March 22, 2005. Its principal place of business is located at 111 Sutter
5
Street, 22nd Floor, San Francisco, California 94104. Since February 2006 Prosper has held itself
6
out, through its Internet website, www.prosper.com, as an online marketplace for ""person to
7
person"" lending.
2.
Prosper has been licensed as a California finance lender (license #605-3227) since
8
December 19, 2005.
9
3.
Prosper submitted an application to register securities with the Division on
10
November 7, 2007. As of the date of this order, Prosper does not yet have an active securities
registration with the State of Alaska.
11
Part 2: Prosper Product Prior to October 16, 2008
12
4.
Prosper's lending platform functioned like a double-blind auction, connecting
13
individuals who wish to borrow money, or ""borrowers,"" with individuals or institutions who wish
14
to commit to purchase loans extended to borrowers, referred to on the platform as ""lenders.""
Lenders and borrowers registered on the website and created Prosper identities. They were
15
prohibited from disclosing their actual identities anywhere on the Prosper website.
16
5.
Borrowers requested three-year, fixed rate, unsecured loans in amounts between
17
$1,000 and $25,000 by posting ""listings"" on the platform indicating the amount they wanted to
borrow and the maximum interest rate they were willing to pay. Prosper assigned borrowers a
18
credit grade based on a commercial credit score obtained from a credit bureau, but Prosper did not
19
verify personal information, such as employment and income.
6.
20
Potential lenders bid on funding all or portions of loans at specified interest rates,
which were typically higher than rates available from depository accounts at financial institutions.
21
Each loan was usually funded with bids by multiple lenders. After an auction closed and a loan
22
was fully bid upon, the borrower received the requested loan with the interest rate set by Prosper
23
and determined by the auction bidding at the lowest rate acceptable to all winning bidders.
24
ITMO: PROSPER MARKETPLACE, INC.
PAGE 2 OF 6
25
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
ORDER NO. 10-04S
1
7.
Individual lenders did not lend money directly to the borrower; rather, the borrower
2
received a loan from a bank with which Prosper has contracted. (Prior to April of 2008, loans
were made directly by Prosper.) The interests in that loan were then sold and assigned through
3
Prosper to the lenders, with each lender receiving an individual non-recourse promissory note.
4
8.
Since the inception of its platform in January 2006, Prosper has initiated
approximately $174 million in loans nationwide. Prosper collected an origination fee from each
5
borrower of one to three percent of loan proceeds, and collected servicing fees from each lender
6
from loan payments at an annual rate of one percent of the outstanding principal balance of the
7
notes.
9.
8
Prosper administered the collection of loan payments from the borrower and the
distribution of such payments to the lenders. Prosper also initiated collection of past due loans
9
from borrowers and assigned delinquent loan accounts to collection agencies. Lenders and
10
borrowers were prohibited from transacting directly and were unable to learn each others' true
identities.
11
10.
Prosper voluntarily suspended all offers and sales of securities on October 16, 2008.
12
11.
Alaska residents have financed Prosper loans totaling more than $666,963.
13
Part 3: Prosper's Omissions in Connection with Sales to Investors
12.
14
Prosper provided information to lenders concerning the issues noted below,
although it did not provide the information in the manner typically required of a securities
15
registrant regarding: details of the company's business model; biographical information about the
16
background and experience of Prosper's management; certain risk factors in connection with the
17
purchase of a Prosper facilitated note, including the fact that the notes were speculative
investments; significant financial risks that investors may be subjected to when investing in the
18
Prosper notes that could result in a complete loss of their investment, such as the fact that
19
borrowers may not fulfill their obligations to make payments for reasons of death or incapacity,
20
bankruptcy, or inability to pay; information concerning Prosper's status as a development stage
company with a limited operating history; and the possibility that Prosper could cease operations at
21
any time due to the failure to raise additional capital, because of a lack of profitability, or because
22
of regulatory concerns.
13.
23
The Prosper website, the company's exclusive mode of dissemination of
information to prospective investors, did not contain financial statements for Prosper, did not
24
ITMO: PROSPER MARKETPLACE, INC.
PAGE 3 OF 6
25
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
ORDER NO. 10-04S
1
disclose that the notes were not registered with the Division, and that Prosper might have
significant contingent liability for the offer and sale of unregistered securities.
2
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
3
1.
The ""notes"" sold by Prosper to Alaska residents are securities, as defined by
4
AS 45.55.990(32).
2.
Prosper sold securities that were not registered with the State of Alaska in violation
5
of AS 45.55.070.
6
3.
In connection with the offer or sale of a security to residents of the state of Alaska
7
Prosper either failed to include information or failed to describe in the manner typically required of
8
a securities registrant certain business or loan information including investment risk factors that
would have aided investors or prospective investors in making an objective decision on whether to
9
invest in the Prosper notes in violation of AS 45.55.010.
10
ORDER

11
1.

14
$3,724 to the Division, such amount to be restricted to the following specific use by the Division:

15
3.
In the event another state securities regulator determines not to accept Prosper's
16
state settlement offer, the total amount of the Alaska payment shall not be affected, and shall
remain at $3,724.
17
4.
This Order concludes the investigation by the Division and any other action that the
18
Division could commence under applicable Alaska law on behalf of the Division as it relates to
19
Prosper, up to and including any activity through November 24, 2008; provided however, that
20
excluded from and not covered by paragraph 1 in this section are any claims by the Division
arising from or relating to the ""Order"" provisions contained herein.
21
5.

22
multistate investigation and is not intended to be used for any other purpose; its findings and

3
7.

4
any private rights or remedies against Prosper, does not limit or create liability of Prosper, or limit
5

INTRODUCTION
7
The Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, Division of Banking
8
and Securities (""division""), is responsible for administration of the Alaska Securities Act (""Act"") at
9
AS 45.55 and the regulations adopted under the Act at 3 AAC 08. Having conducted an
10
investigation pursuant to AS 45.55.910(a)(1), the division finds as follows:
11
II. FACTS
12
1. The 13th Regional Corporation (13th Region) is an Alaska Native corporation organized
13
under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).
14
2. During the calendar year 2006, the 13th Region did not file any proxy or proxy-related
15
materials with the division under AS 45.55.139.
16
3. In late 2007, pursuant to AS 45.55.139, the 13th Region filed materials related to its 2007
17
Annual Meeting. The materials contained a 2007 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Info
18
Statement (proxy statement), a proxy form, an early bird prize form, and a 2006 Annual Report. The
19
proxy statement contained an undated letter from Michael Rawley, Chairman of the Board, detailing
20
plans and expectations for the 13th Region during the 2007 operating year. Mr. Rawley states that
21
the 13th Region will show a net profit of $700,000 for the 2007 operating year. In addition, he
22
discusses the hiring of Joseph D. Mace as CEO/CFO, the role of Mr. Mace and President Jackie
23
Rashleger, the movement of the 13th Region's land entitlement initiative and HR 5617, the profitable
24
return of the 13th Region's operations, and the date and location of the 2007 annual meeting, which
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-05-S
PAGE 1 OF 8
1
was scheduled for February 23, 2008, at the Tukwila Marriott Courtyard Hotel. In his letter, Mr.
2
Rawley does not discuss the 2006 operating year which ended on December 31, 2006.
3
4. A shareholder complaint was filed on February 6, 2008, alleging information contained in
4
the 13th Region's 2007 proxy statement was in violation of the administrative code regulating
5
ANCSA proxy solicitations. The complaint alleges:
6
a) a violation of 3 AAC 08.315 for the failure to reference the 2006 operating results and
7
instead discussing the projections of the 2007 operating results in a letter to shareholders by
8
Michael Rawley, Chairman of the Board;
9
b) a violation of 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2) for the failure of the 13th Region to disclose all
10
remuneration for the five most highly compensated directors or officers; and
11
c) a violation of 3 AAC 08.345(b)(5), for the failure to disclose information related to the
12
corporation's relationship with its independent public accountants.
13
III. LEGAL STANDARDS
14
1. A corporation subject to AS 45.55.139 is required to file with the division proxy solicitation
15
materials that the corporation distributes to 30 or more Alaska resident shareholders.
16
2. Under AS 45.55.160 ""[a] person may not, in a document filed with the administrator or in a
17
proceeding under this chapter, make or cause to be made an untrue statement of a material fact or
18
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
19
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.""
20
3. 3 AAC 08.315(a) states, in relevant part, ""[a] solicitation may not be made by means of a
21
proxy statement, proxy, notice of meeting, or other communication that contains a material
22
misrepresentation. A misrepresentation is a statement that, at the time and under the circumstances
23
in which it is made (1) is false or misleading with respect to a material fact; (2) omits a material fact
24
necessary in order to make a statement made in the solicitation not false or misleading; or (3) omits a
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-05-S
PAGE 2 OF 8
1
material fact necessary to correct a statement, in an earlier communication regarding the solicitation
2
of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter, which has become false or misleading. A
3
misrepresentation is material if there is substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would
4
consider it important in deciding how to vote.""
5
4. 3 AAC 08.345(a) requires, in relevant part, ""[t]he solicitation of proxies on behalf of the
6
board for an annual meeting must be preceded or accompanied by the annual report for the
7
corporation's last fiscal year, unless (1) the solicitation is made on behalf of the board before the
8
annual report is available; (2) solicitation is being made at the time in opposition to the board; and
9
(3) the board's proxy statement includes an undertaking to furnish the annual report to all
10
shareholders being solicited at least 50 days before the date of the annual meeting.""
11
5. 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2) requires an ANCSA corporation to provide shareholders a disclosure
12
statement that includes ""all current remuneration distributed or accrued and
all future
13
remuneration contributed during the corporation's last fiscal year on behalf of (A) each of the five
14
most highly compensated directors or officers for his services in all capacities to the corporation and
15
its subsidiaries, naming each such person; and (B) all officers and directors as a group, stating the
16
number of persons in the group without naming them; future remuneration contributed includes
17
amounts which were reported in the corporation's annual report for the last fiscal year for annuity,
18
pension or retirement plans and for deferred compensation or profit sharing plans.""
19
6. 3 AAC 08.345(b), in relevant part, requires: ""(b) The solicitation of proxies on behalf of the
20
board must be preceded or accompanied by a dated, written proxy statement including
(5) if
21
action is to be taken on the election of directors or other matters for which the financial statements
22
are material to the exercise of prudent judgment, a description of the corporation's relationship with
23
its independent public accountants; this description must include
(D) the percentage relationship
24
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-05-S
PAGE 3 OF 8
1
which the aggregate of the fees for all nonaudit services bears to the aggregate of fees for both audit
2
and nonaudit services performed by the principal accountant and paid for by the corporation.""
3
IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
4
1.
The 13th Region is subject to the requirements of AS 45.55.139 and pertinent regulations
5
due to its having 500 or more shareholders and assets exceeding $1,000,000 during the time period
6
relevant to this investigation.
7
2. The proxy materials for the 2007 annual meeting included a proxy, notice of annual meeting
8
and proxy statement, and the 2006 annual report. The proxy statement included a letter from
9
Michael Rawley, Chairman of the Board, that detailed the activities of the 13th Region and the
10
anticipated financial results for the 2007 operating year. Complainant alleges that Mr. Rawley's
11
letter should have discussed the 2006 operating results, and that not doing so is a violation of
12
AS 45.55.160. 3 AAC 08.345(b) specifies the annual report either precede or be accompanied with
13
a proxy solicitation, unless the solicitation is made on behalf of the board before the annual report is
14
available. At the time of Mr. Rawley's letter, the 2007 operating year had not been completed, and
15
therefore the 2007 annual report was not available. The 13th Region included the 2006 annual report
16
with the proxy statement, proxy, and other materials. Mr. Rawley's letter clearly identified that the
17
financial data and other information related to the management of the corporation and the annual
18
meeting of shareholders were for the current operating year (2007). The division finds the letter to
19
shareholders by Michael Rawley did not violate AS 45.55.160 or 3 AAC 08.315(a).
20
3. The proxy statement contained partial information regarding remuneration to the five most
21
highly paid officers and directors. The information in the 2007 proxy statement detailed salaries
22
paid during 2005. 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2) requires a proxy statement to contain ""a statement of all
23
current remuneration distributed or accrued and all future remuneration contributed during
the
24
corporation's last fiscal year
"" 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2)(A) and (B) require disclosure of all
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-05-S
PAGE 4 OF 8
1
remuneration contributed to the five most highly paid directors or officers, naming each such person,
2
and the remuneration paid to all officers and directors as a group, stating the number of persons in
3
the group without naming them. The division finds the 13th Region failed to make the disclosures
4
required by 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2). The information disclosed was not from the last fiscal year, which
5
would have been 2006, since the 2007 operating year had not yet been completed. The division
6
further finds the facts not disclosed in the proxy statement under 3 AAC 08.345(b)(2)(A) and (B) are
7
material omissions under AS 45.55.160 and 3 AAC 08.315(a). The statement contained in the proxy
8
statement did not disclose ""all current remuneration distributed or accrued and
all future
9
remuneration contributed during the corporation's last fiscal year"" for the five most highly
10
compensated directors or officers, and did not contain the required information for all officers and
11
directors as a group.
12
4. 3 AAC 08.345(b)(5) requires a statement regarding services provided by an independent
13
third-party accountant during the last fiscal year. The proxy statement includes the following
14
description of accounting services provided by Peterson Sullivan, PLLC:
15
""(a) audit services in conjunction with the examination of the Corporation's financial
16
statements; and (b) non-audit tax and professional services. The tax services consisted
17
of tax planning, preparing and filing of federal and state returns. They also provided
18
professional services, including audit and other accounting services. They provided
19
89% of such services for 2005.'
20
In addition, the proxy statement stated that ""Patrick Rhodes & Associates, PLLC provided end of the
21
month review during 2005 for 11% of the total for professional accounting services.""
22
3 AAC 08.345(b)(5)(D) requires the percentage relationship which the aggregate of the fees for all
23
nonaudit services bears to the aggregate of fees for both audit and nonaudit services performed by
24
the principal accountant. The comparison for Peterson Sullivan, PLLC and Patrick Rhodes &
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-05-S
PAGE 5 OF 8
1
Associates, PLLC were the percentage services provide by each firm, and not an aggregation of the
2
services performed by the principal accountant. Additionally, the certified public accountants who
3
prepared the 2006 Independent Auditor's Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 13th
4
Region and its subsidiaries are not mentioned in the proxy statement disclosures for the 2007 annual
5
meeting. The division finds the 13th Region failed to make the disclosures required under 3 AAC
6
08.345(b)(5), because the information disclosed was not for the last fiscal year. The division further
7
finds the 13th Region failed to meet the disclosure required under 3 AAC 08.345(b)(5)(D), because
8
the information did not include statements regarding the percentage relationship which the aggregate
9
of the fees for all nonaudit services bears to the aggregate of fees for both audit and nonaudit
10
services performed by the principal accountant and paid for by the corporation.
11
5. On June 27, 2006, the division and the 13th Region agreed to Consent Order 06-09 S. The
12
13th Region agreed not to commit any future violations of the ANCSA proxy regulations. The
13
division finds the 13th Region to be in violation of Consent Order 06-09 S.
14

without admitting or denying the truth thereof, that the following allegations contained in the
5
Notice of Hearing shall be adopted as the Division's Findings of Fact; and consents to the entry of

this Order by the Division:
7
NOW, THEREFORE, the Division enters this order:
8
I.
9
FINDINGS OF FACT
10
Unethical Practices in the Offer and Sale of ARS
11
1.
ARS are financial instruments that include auction preferred shares of closed-end
12
funds, municipal auction rate bonds, and various asset-backed auction rate bonds (collectively
13
referred to herein as ""ARS""). ARS are long-term instruments for which the interest/dividend is
14
reset weekly or monthly.
15
2.
Morgan Stanley participated in the marketing and sale of ARS.
16
3.
In certain instances, Morgan Stanley, through its salespeople, advised certain clients
17
that ARS were safe, liquid investments, when in fact ARS had significant liquidity risks associated
18
with them.
19
4.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley represented to certain customers of Morgan
20
Stanley that ARS were short-term investments. In fact, because ARS are bonds with long-term
21
maturities, their short-term liquidity was dependent on the successful operation of a bidding
22
process known as a Dutch auction. Certain representatives of Morgan Stanley failed to disclose to
23
certain customers with short-term liquidity needs that they might be unable to sell their ARS if the
24
auction process failed.
ITMO: MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INC.
ORDER NO: 10-08-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 15
1
5.
In connection with the sale of ARS, certain Morgan Stanley salespeople told certain
2
investors that ARS were ""just like cash"" and ""liquid with seven-days notice.""
3
6.
Morgan Stanley marketed ARS to investors within a brochure entitled ""Money
4
Market Instruments."" Within this brochure, ARS are listed under the subsection ""Other Short-
5
Term Instruments.""
6
7.
Since it began participating in the ARS market, Morgan Stanley submitted support
7
bids-purchase orders for the entirety of an auction rate security issue for which it acted as the sole
8
or lead broker. Support bids were Morgan Stanley proprietary orders that would be filled, in
9
whole or in part, if there were otherwise insufficient demand in an auction. When Morgan Stanley
10
purchased ARS through support bids, ARS were then owned by Morgan Stanley and the holdings
11
were recorded on Morgan Stanley's balance sheet. For risk management purposes, Morgan
12
Stanley imposed limits on the amounts of ARS it could hold in inventory.
13
8.
Because many investors could not ascertain how much of an auction was filled
14
through Morgan Stanley proprietary trades, they could not determine if auctions at Morgan Stanley
15
were clearing because of normal marketplace demand, or because Morgan Stanley was making up
16
for the lack of demand through support bids. Generally, investors were also not aware that the
17
liquidity of the ARS as to which Morgan Stanley was the managing broker-dealer depended upon
18
Morgan Stanley's continued use of support bids. While Morgan Stanley could track its own
19
inventory as a measure of the supply and demand for its ARS, ordinary investors had no
20
comparable ability to assess the operation of Morgan Stanley's auctions. There was no way for
21
such investors to monitor supply and demand in the market or to assess when broker-dealers might
22
decide to stop supporting the market, thereby causing its collapse.

ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 3 OF 15

9.
Starting in August 2007, the credit crisis and other deteriorating market conditions
2
strained the ARS market. Some institutional investors withdrew from the market, decreasing
3
demand for ARS.
4
10.
The resulting market dislocation should have been evident to Morgan Stanley.
5
Morgan Stanley's support bids filled the increasing gap in the demand in its auctions for ARS,
6
sustaining the impression that the demand for ARS had not decreased. As a result, Morgan
7
Stanley's ARS inventory grew significantly, requiring Morgan Stanley to raise its risk management
8
limits on its ARS inventory.
9
11. From the fall of 2007 through February of 2008, demand for ARS continued to
10
erode and Morgan Stanley's ARS inventory reached unprecedented levels. Morgan Stanley
11
eventually became aware of the increasing strains in the ARS market, and recognized the potential
12
for widespread market failure. Morgan Stanley never disclosed these increasing risks of owning or
13
purchasing ARS to its customers.
14
12.
In February 2008, Morgan Stanley and other firms stopped supporting the auctions.
15
Without the benefit of support bids, the ARS market collapsed, leaving investors who had been led
16
to believe that these securities were cash alternative investments appropriate for managing short-
17
term cash needs, holding long-term or perpetual securities that could not be sold at par value until
18
and if the auctions cleared again.
19
Failure to Supervise
20
13.
Although ARS are complex products, Morgan Stanley did not provide its sales or
21
marketing staff with the training necessary to adequately explain these products or the mechanics
22
of the auction process to their customers.

Morgan Stanley did not adequately train all of its brokers and financial advisers

WHEREAS, Goldman Sachs elects to permanently waive any right to a hearing and appeal
under the Alaska Securities Act, AS 45.55, (the ""Act"") and to judicial review of this Consent Order;
and
WHEREAS, Goldman Sachs acknowledges, without admitting or denying the Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law contained in this Order, and consents to the entry of this Order by the
Division.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Division, as administrator of the Act, hereby enters this
Order.
FINDINGS OF FACT
1.
Auction rate securities are long-term bonds issued by municipalities, corporations,
and student loan companies, or perpetual equity instruments issued by closed-end mutual funds that
pay an interest rate that resets periodically through a bidding process known as a Dutch auction.
2.
Goldman Sachs participated in the marketing and sale of ARS.
3.
Goldman Sachs acted as an underwriter and as the auction broker-dealer for certain
issues of auction rate securities. When acting as sole manager, Goldman Sachs was the only firm
that could submit bids into the auction on behalf of its clients and/or other broker-dealers who
wanted to buy and/or sell any auction rate securities in such auctions. When acting as lead manager,
Goldman Sachs was the primary firm that could submit bids into the auction, but other auction
broker-dealers were able to submit orders on behalf of their clients as well. Goldman Sachs received
revenue in connection with auction rate securities, including an underwriting fee representing a
percentage of total issuance and a fee for managing the auctions.
4.
Goldman Sachs conveyed to certain clients that ARS were secure, liquid securities
that were a suitable alternative for cash management purposes. It did so through its sales force,
ITMO: GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.
ORDER NO: 10-14-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 2 OF 17
some of whom represented to certain investors that auction rate securities were highly liquid, safe
investments for cash management purposes.
5.
These representations were misleading as to certain investors. Auction rate securities
were in fact different from cash and money market funds. As discussed above, the liquidity of an
auction rate security relied on the successful operation of the Dutch auction process. In the event of
a failed auction, investors cannot sell their auction rate securities in that auction and are potentially
stuck holding long-term investments, not money market instruments. As discussed below, starting in
the fall of 2007, the auction rate securities market faced dislocation and an increased risk of auction
failure.
6.
Since it began participating in the auction rate securities market, Goldman Sachs
submitted ""cover"" bids, purchase orders for the entirety of an auction rate security issue for which it
acted as the sole or lead auction manager. Such ""cover"" bids were Goldman Sachs proprietary
orders that would be filled, in whole or in part, if there was otherwise insufficient demand in an
auction. When Goldman Sachs purchased auction rate securities through ""cover"" bids, those auction
rate securities were then owned by Goldman Sachs and the holdings were recorded on Goldman
Sachs' balance sheet. For risk management purposes, Goldman Sachs imposed limits on the
amounts of securities its Municipal Money Markets unit could hold (which included Goldman
Sachs' auction rate securities holdings).
7.
Because many investors could not ascertain how much of an auction was filled
through Goldman Sachs ""cover"" bids, those investors could not determine if auctions were clearing
because of normal marketplace demand, or because Goldman Sachs was making up for the lack of
demand through ""cover"" bids. Many investors were also not aware that the liquidity of the auction
rate securities was dependent upon Goldman Sachs' continued use of ""cover"" bids. While Goldman
Sachs could track its own inventory as a measure of the supply and demand for its auction rate
ITMO: GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.
ORDER NO: 10-14-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 3 OF 17
securities, many investors had no comparable ability to assess the operation of the auctions. There
was no way for those investors to monitor supply and demand in the market or to assess when
broker-dealers might decide to stop supporting the market, which could cause its collapse.
8.
In August of 2007, the credit crisis and other deteriorating market conditions began to
strain the auction rate securities market. Some institutional investors withdrew from the market,
decreasing demand for auction rate securities.
9.
The resulting market dislocation should have been evident to Goldman Sachs. When
client demand for its auction rate securities declined, Goldman Sachs' ""cover"" bids filled the
increasing shortfall, thereby sustaining the impression for certain investors that auctions managed by
Goldman Sachs were functioning. As a result, Goldman Sachs' auction rate securities inventory
grew significantly, requiring Goldman Sachs to raise its risk management limits for its Municipal
Money Markets business (which included auction rate securities) several times.
10.
From the Fall of 2007 through early February of 2008, demand for auction rate
securities continued to erode and Goldman Sachs' auction rate securities inventory increased
significantly. Goldman Sachs was aware of the increasing strains in the auction rate securities
market, and increasingly questioned the viability of the auction rate securities market. Goldman
Sachs did not disclose these increasing risks of owning or purchasing auction rate securities to all of
its clients.
11.
In February of 2008, Goldman Sachs and other firms stopped supporting auctions.
Without the benefit of ""cover"" bids, the auction rate securities market collapsed, leaving certain
investors who had been led to believe that these securities were liquid, safe investments appropriate
for managing short-term cash needs, holding long-term or perpetual securities that could not be sold
at par value until and if the auctions cleared again.
ITMO: GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.
ORDER NO: 10-14-S
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER
PAGE 4 OF 17
Failure to Supervise
12.
Goldman Sachs did not adequately supervise certain of its salespeople to ensure that
all of the firm's clients would be sufficiently apprised of ARS, the mechanics of the auction process,
and the potential illiquidity of ARS, including the fact that Goldman Sachs may stop submitting
""cover"" bids, as discussed above.
II.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
13.
The Division has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Act.
14.
The Division finds that the above conduct subjects Goldman Sachs to sanctions under
AS 45.55.060(a)(7) (unethical practice in the offer and sale of securities), and AS 45.55.060(b)(1)
(failure to supervise) of the Act.
15.
Nothing in this Order shall be construed as a finding or admission of fraud.
16.
The Division finds the following relief appropriate and in the public interest.
III.
ORDER
On the basis of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Goldman Sachs' consent to the
entry of this Order, for the sole purpose of settling this matter, prior to a hearing and without
admitting or denying any of the Findings of Fact or Conclusions of Law,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
17.
This Order concludes the investigation by the Division and any other action that the
Division could commence under applicable Alaska law on behalf of the State of Alaska as it relates
to Goldman Sachs' marketing and sale of auction rate securities to Goldman Sachs' Eligible
Investors, as defined below.

other purpose.

AS 45.55.060(a)(7) and AS 45.55.060(b)(1) of the Act in connection with the marketing and sale of
ARS.
21.
Goldman Sachs shall pay the sum of Forty-Six Thousand Nine Dollars and Twenty-
Two Cents ($46,009.22) to the Division as a civil monetary payment, which amount constitutes
Alaska's proportionate share of the state settlement amount of Twenty-Two Million, Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($22,500,000.00), which shall be payable to the State of Alaska within ten (10)
days of the date on which this Order is entered.

Sachs' settlement offer, the total amount of the payment to the State of Alaska shall not be affected.

Relief for Municipal Issuers
41.
Goldman Sachs shall promptly refund to municipal issuers refinancing fees paid to

between February 11, 2008, and the date of this Order, where Goldman Sachs acted as underwriter
for the initial primary offering of the auction rate securities between August 1, 2007, and February
11, 2008. Nothing in this Order precludes the Division from pursuing any other civil action that may
arise with regard to auction rate securities other than the marketing and sale of auction rate securities
to retail investors.
42.
Goldman Sachs agrees to waive any right to indemnification and/or claims of
contribution, and/or other similar remedies with respect to any costs, expenses, or losses in

44.
This Order shall not disqualify Goldman Sachs or any of its affiliates or current or
former employees from any business that they otherwise are qualified or licensed to perform under
applicable state law and this Order is not intended to form the basis for any disqualification.
45.
To the extent applicable, this Order hereby waives any disqualification from relying
upon the registration exemptions or registration safe harbor provisions that may be contained in the
federal securities laws, the rules and regulations thereunder, the rules and regulations of self
regulatory organizations or any states' or U.S. Territories' securities laws. In addition, this Order is
not intended to form the basis for any such disqualifications. In addition, this Order is not intended

46.
Except in an action by the Division to enforce the obligations of Goldman Sachs in
this Order, this Order may neither be deemed nor used as an admission of or evidence of any alleged
fault, omission, or liability of Goldman Sachs in any civil, criminal, arbitration, or administrative
proceeding in any court, administrative agency, or tribunal. For any person or entity not a party to
this Order, this Order does not limit or create any private right against Goldman Sachs including,

Evidence of a violation of this Order proven in a court of competent jurisdiction shall
constitute prima facie proof of a violation of the Act in any civil action or proceeding hereafter
commenced by the Division against Goldman Sachs.
49.
Should the Division prove in a court of competent jurisdiction that a material breach
of this Order by Goldman Sachs has occurred, Goldman Sachs shall pay to the Division the cost, if
any, of such determination and of enforcing this Order including without limitation legal fees,
expenses, and court costs.
50.
If Goldman Sachs fails to make the payment specified in paragraph 21, the Division,
at its sole discretion, may pursue any legal remedies, including but not limited to initiating an action
to enforce the Order, revoking Goldman Sachs' registration within the state, or terminating this
Order.
51.
If in any proceeding, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a court of competent
jurisdiction, including an administrative proceeding by a state securities administrator, finds that
there was a material breach of this Order, the Division, at its sole discretion, may terminate the
Order. If Goldman Sachs defaults on any other obligation under this Order, the Division may, at its
sole discretion, pursue legal remedies to enforce the Order or pursue an administrative action,
including but not limited an action to revoke Goldman Sachs' registration within the state. Goldman
Sachs agrees that any statute of limitations or other time related defenses applicable to the subject of
the Order and any claims arising from or relating thereto are tolled from and after the date of this
Order. In the event of such termination, Goldman Sachs expressly agrees and acknowledges that this
Order shall in no way bar or otherwise preclude the Division from commencing, conducting, or
prosecuting any investigation, action, or proceeding, however denominated, related to the Order,
against Goldman Sachs, or from using in any way any statements, documents, or other materials

Goldman Sachs shall cooperate fully and promptly with the Division and shall use its
best efforts to ensure that all the current and former officers, directors, trustees, agents, members,
partners, and employees of Goldman Sachs (and of any of Goldman Sachs' parent companies,

the Division, of all documents or other tangible evidence requested by the Division and any
compilations or summaries of information or data that the Division requests that Goldman

the extent such production would require the disclosure of information protected by the
attorney-client and/or work product privileges;
(b)
without the necessity of a subpoena, having the current (and making all
reasonable efforts to cause the former) officers, directors, trustees, agents, members, partners,
and employees of Goldman Sachs (and of any of the Goldman Sachs' parent companies,

I. INTRODUCTION
8
The Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, Division of Banking
9
and Securities (the division), is responsible for administration of the Alaska Securities Act (the Act)
10
at AS 45.55 and the regulations adopted under the Act at 3 AAC 08. Having conducted an
11
investigation pursuant to AS 45.55.910(a)(1), the division finds as follows:
12
II. FACTS
13
1. CA Gold, LLC (CA Gold) is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
14
state of Alaska, and received a Certificate of Organization on October 17, 2009.
15
2. CA Gold filed its initial report on April 16, 2010, with the Division of Corporations,
16
Business and Professional Licensing listing Jamie Baker and Caalee A. Dilley as the members of CA
17
Gold, with Jamie Baker designated as the manager of the CA Gold.
18
3. On or about November 15, 2009, CA Gold produced and distributed a video presentation
19
that referenced its development of mining claims known as Rusty Creek. The video presentation
20
included a solicitation for investors, which included a description of the minimum investment and
21
the anticipated return an investor should expect to receive as a result of the operation of the mine.
22
4. On or about December 13, 2009, CA Gold or a person acting on behalf of CA Gold posted
23
the videos on YouTube.com, an online public forum where posted videos can be viewed by any
24
person visiting the website. The videos included email contact information for CA Gold.
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-20-S

1
5. On June 6, 2010, a complaint was filed alleging CA Gold was conducting public
2
solicitations for shareholders by using a video website, Youtube.com.
3
6. On November 17, 2010, CA Gold provided a copy of an LLC membership certificate issued
4
to purchasers evidencing the percent of ownership held by the member. The certificate did not have
5
a legend as required under AS 45.55.900(b)(5) et seq.
6
III. LEGAL STANDARDS
7
1. An issuer is required by AS 45.55.070 to register a security, file a notice as a federal
8
covered security, or receive or qualify for an exemption under AS 45.55.900.
9
2. An issuer selling securities subject to an exemption under AS 45.55.900(b)(5)(A) - (C) is
10
restricted from engaging in any form of public solicitation.
11
3. An issuer selling securities subject to an exemption under AS 45.55.900(b)(5) must place a
12
legend on the certificate or other document evidencing ownership of the security, stating that the
13
security is not registered under the Act and cannot be resold without registration under the Act or
14
exemption from it.
15
IV. FINDINGS
16
1. CA Gold did not file a registration or notice of exemption with the division in accordance
17
with AS 45.55.070. An issuer is in violation of AS 45.55.920, if a security is offered for sale has not
18
been properly registered under AS 45.55.070.
19
2. CA Gold did file an exemption notice with the division under AS 45.55.900(b)(5).
20
3. The distribution of videos on Youtube.com by CA Gold is considered a public solicitation.
21
4. CA Gold did not qualify for a self-executing exemption under AS 45.55.900(b)(5)(C),
22
because AS 45.55.900(b)(5)(B)(vi) which is referred to in AS 45.55.900(b)(5)(C), prohibits the use
23
of any public solicitation.
24
ALASKA ORDER NO. 10-20-S

5. If CA Gold wanted to rely on a self-executing exemption, the certificates of shareholder
2
interest issued by CA Gold did not comply with AS 45.55.900(b)(5)(A)(ii) or (5)(B)(iv), which
3
require that ""a legend is placed on the certificate or other document evidencing ownership of the
4
security, stating that the security is not registered under this chapter and cannot be resold without
5
registration under this chapter or exemption.""
6
V.
ORDER AND NOTICE
7
1. Pursuant to AS 45.55.920(a)(1) and (c), the Administrator finds CA Gold committed several

Order.
